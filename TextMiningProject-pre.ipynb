      "1.3.n So tonight we’re facing something else now, is communion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.n Three years I waited for a church to come in Tucson, but it’s here.\n",
      "2.2.n Yeah, we’re here.\n",
      "2.3.n So we thank the Lord, He just let us wait till we can appreciate it now.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1.n Now, there’s one thing that I’d want to say just before we start the communion, is this, that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in, that we ought to really give (every) all of our being to God.\n",
      "3.2.n We should really serve God.\n",
      "3.3.n I believe that He has blessed us with the direct answer to Scripture.\n",
      "3.4.n As Brother Pearry gave it a few moments ago, that we are—we’re at that time.\n",
      "3.5.n We’re not blind, we see that we’re here, we’ve arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.1.n And we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people.\n",
      "4.2.n That, we can’t stay too much longer, we’d be in a complete insane institution, the whole world would be.\n",
      "4.3.n See?\n",
      "4.4.n So we’re at the end time.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.1.n Now, as Brother Pearry ended up there, seeing these things are true, see that they are true, they’re not myth.\n",
      "5.2.n They’re not just something that we imagine.\n",
      "5.3.n They’re something that’s been directly given to us by the Word of God and manifested publicly before us, that we know we are here.\n",
      "5.4.n We don’t know how long now, because again we come back to a watch, you see, what time it is.\n",
      "5.5.n But we are … we know we’re here, we’re at the time.\n",
      "5.6.n Whether God’s time, I’d imagine …\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.n Someone give a little analysis one time that said that if God put up with him according … if He was to allot time, one thousand years is just one day.\n",
      "6.2.n So if a man lived seventy years old, it’d just be a few minutes of God’s time.\n",
      "6.3.n See?\n",
      "6.4.n Well, and said it’d be forty years, that wouldn’t even mean time, hardly, He could bat His eye.\n",
      "6.5.n See?\n",
      "6.6.n See, just that’s how quick it is, the whole thing, if it be lotted time; which, He doesn’t have any time.\n",
      "6.7.n So He just is Eternal.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.1.n I believe it was Sarah back there … or, no, Joseph, the other night, said to me and Brother Pearry.\n",
      "7.2.n He said, “Daddy, where, when did God come on the scene?\n",
      "7.3.n Where did He come from?”\n",
      "7.4.n See?\n",
      "7.5.n “He had to have a beginning, didn’t He?\n",
      "7.6.n Didn’t He have to start?”\n",
      "\n",
      "8.1.n I said, “No.\n",
      "8.2.n Anything that has a beginning has an end, but it’s that which had not a beginning has no end.”\n",
      "8.3.n Of course, he’s ten years old, that was kind of a real mouthful for him.\n",
      "8.4.n See?\n",
      "8.5.n And how could he receive that, knowing that something never did begin?\n",
      "8.6.n Not only to him, it is to me.\n",
      "8.7.n Now, see, it’s just a great big dose for me, how it did ever begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "9.1.n Now we’re fixing to observe something here that’s really sacred.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.1.n I was called on a few days ago, to some very fine Christian gentlemen that’s never had this, and he understood that we taken communion literally.\n",
      "10.2.n They take it what they call “spiritual communion.”\n",
      "10.3.n And which, as far as communion, I’d say all right, ’cause communicate is “to talk to,” see.\n",
      "10.4.n And the brother give me this Scripture, said, “Brother Branham, don’t you think now … ”\n",
      "\n",
      "11.1.n Now, reason I’m saying this …\n",
      "11.2.n It’s all right, Brother Pearry?\n",
      "11.3.n [Brother Pearry Green answers, “Sure.”]\n",
      "11.4.n See, that reason I’m saying this, so that you would understand what you’re doing.\n",
      "11.5.n You don’t … if you walk into anything blindly, you don’t know where, what you’re doing.\n",
      "11.6.n You can’t have even confidence if you don’t know what you’re doing.\n",
      "11.7.n But you must understand what you are doing and why you’re doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.1.n He said, “Now if we take the Word of God, isn’t that God that we’re taking?”\n",
      "\n",
      "13.1.n I said, “Exactly right, sir, it’s true.\n",
      "13.2.n But we read here that they actually …\n",
      "13.3.n Paul taught taking the literal Lord’s supper.\n",
      "13.4.n ‘This do in remembrance of Me,’ said Jesus.\n",
      "13.5.n ‘As oft as you take it in remembrance of Me, you show forth the Lord’s death till He comes.’”\n",
      "13.6.n See?\n",
      "13.7.n Now, we are to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "14.1.n We understand that Saint Paul, who ordained it in the Church, being the prophet of the New Testament.\n",
      "14.2.n Peter, James, John, all of them, they wrote (why, Matthew, Mark, Luke) what Jesus did, as scribes.\n",
      "14.3.n But Paul set the thing in order, he was he was the prophet of the New Testament.\n",
      "14.4.n Just as Moses went into the wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the five Books of … the first five Books of the Bible, well, Paul also went into the desert and received inspiration from God, to set the New Testament Church in order and type It with the Old.\n",
      "\n",
      "15.1.n Under there they had the sacrificial lamb, that Israel kept that for a memorial.\n",
      "15.2.n It was actually used one time, coming out of Egypt.\n",
      "15.3.n But then they kept that as a memorial all down through the age.\n",
      "15.4.n Well, “if the law being a shadow of things to come,” you see.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.1.n Now, I do believe that communion (what we call “communion,” now) is to … is “the Lord’s supper.”\n",
      "\n",
      "17.1.n Now, we only have three physical Divine orders left to us: one of them is communion; feet-washing; water baptism.\n",
      "17.2.n That’s the only three things.\n",
      "17.3.n That’s the perfection, of the three, see.\n",
      "17.4.n And that’s the only three orders we have.\n",
      "17.5.n We realize that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament.\n",
      "\n",
      "18.1.n Now, if we would say “the communion should just be taking the Word,” I don’t believe anyone has a right to take the Lord’s supper until he has taken the Word of the Lord into his heart.\n",
      "18.2.n See?\n",
      "18.3.n Because I’m going …\n",
      "18.4.n I’ll read something for you in a few moments and you’ll see.\n",
      "18.5.n Now, notice.\n",
      "18.6.n Then, why then would we would …\n",
      "\n",
      "19.1.n On the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army.\n",
      "19.2.n They do not believe in any form of water baptism, said, “We don’t need it.”\n",
      "19.3.n Now, if we don’t need water baptism, why are we baptized?\n",
      "19.4.n Said, “The water can’t save you, the Blood saves you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "20.1.n I’ll agree with that.\n",
      "20.2.n That’s right, the Blood saves you, not the water.\n",
      "20.3.n But we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inwardly work of grace has been done.\n",
      "20.4.n See?\n",
      "20.5.n So must we on communion!\n",
      "\n",
      "21.1.n When we have taken the Lord, our Sacrifice, into us, as a matter of spiritual Birth into us, and His Body, we live by Him by the Word, we also should symbolize it because it’s a commandment.\n",
      "21.2.n “Repent, every one of you and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins.”\n",
      "\n",
      "22.1.n Paul said, “I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, ‘That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread, and brake it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take and eat, this do in remembrance of Me.”\n",
      "22.2.n For as often as you take this bread, you show forth His death till He comes.’”\n",
      "22.3.n Now we find out that, in that, they had people who come and …\n",
      "\n",
      "23.1.n This precious brother, a very dear brother, he came and he said, “I never did take it, Brother Branham, I don’t understand what it is.”\n",
      "23.2.n Said, “I been taught the other side.”\n",
      "\n",
      "24.1.n I said, “But remember, we will admit that Saint Paul set it in order in the early Christian Church.\n",
      "24.2.n They went from church … from house to house, broke the bread with singleness of heart, and so forth.\n",
      "24.3.n Now,” I said, “he did put it in the Church.\n",
      "24.4.n Galatians 1:8, he said, ‘If an angel from heaven comes and says anything else, let it be accursed,’ you see, see, the same one that had them to be rebaptized again from the baptism of John, to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.”\n",
      "\n",
      "25.1.n You see, there are three things that we must—three things that we must do as symbols: the Lord’s supper, feet-washing, water baptism.\n",
      "25.2.n See?\n",
      "25.3.n There’s …\n",
      "\n",
      "26.1.n You say, “Well, the … ”\n",
      "26.2.n Now, the Salvation Army takes it from the point, “The dying thief, when he died, he wasn’t baptized, yet Jesus said he would be in Heaven.”\n",
      "26.3.n That’s exactly the truth.\n",
      "26.4.n That’s exact.\n",
      "26.5.n But, you see, he only recognized Jesus right there in the hour he was dying.\n",
      "26.6.n See?\n",
      "26.7.n That’s the only—that’s the only opportunity he had.\n",
      "26.8.n He was a thief, he was away, he was out.\n",
      "26.9.n And he, as soon as he seen that Light, he recognized It, “Lord, remember me!”\n",
      "26.10.n And Jesus …\n",
      "26.11.n That was true.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.1.n But to you and I who know that we should be baptized, and refuse to do it, then that’ll be between you and God.\n",
      "27.2.n Same thing in communion!\n",
      "\n",
      "28.1.n Now, when we take this communion, it isn’t just the thing say, “I’m coming up here and going to eat some bread, and I’ll believe I’m a Christian.”\n",
      "28.2.n But, if you noticed, the Bible said, “He that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the Blood and the Body of the Lord.”\n",
      "28.3.n See?\n",
      "28.4.n You’ve got to live a life that … before the people, that … and before God and the people, that shows that you are—that you are sincere.\n",
      "\n",
      "29.1.n Now, just a moment longer.\n",
      "29.2.n Now, in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a statute or an ordinance.\n",
      "29.3.n And so is water baptism an ordinance; so is feet-washing an ordinance; so is the Lord’s supper an ordinance.\n",
      "29.4.n “Blessed is he that does all of His ordinance, keeps all of His statutes, all of His commandments, that he might have a right to enter into the Tree of Life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "30.1.n Now, notice in this now, that in that first, when it was first an ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church, and to the temple and the altar, and offer your gift, and for your sins, the sacrifice of a lamb.\n",
      "30.2.n Well, I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road, knowing that he was guilty, and he goes to the altar; or brings his fat ox or a bullock, or whatever he had, or a ram, lamb, something.\n",
      "30.3.n He had brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come, he walked up there, keeping God’s ordinance just as sincerely as he could.\n",
      "\n",
      "31.1.n Then he laid his hands upon it, confessing his sins, and the priest placing this (his sins) upon the lamb, and the lamb’s throat was cut, and then died for him.\n",
      "31.2.n As he laid there, the little lamb kicking and bleeding, his hands being full of blood, and it flying all over him, (the little lamb blatting, dying), he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place.\n",
      "31.3.n Therefore, he was offering this lamb’s death for his death.\n",
      "31.4.n See, the lamb died in his place.\n",
      "31.5.n Then the man done it with sincerity, with deepness of his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "32.1.n Finally, over and over it went again, over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition.\n",
      "32.2.n The commandment of God became a tradition to the people.\n",
      "32.3.n And then here he come down, “Well, let’s see, this is so-and-so today, maybe I better go down.\n",
      "32.4.n Yeah, I better offer a bullock.”\n",
      "32.5.n He went down, “Well, Lord, here’s my bullock.”\n",
      "32.6.n See, there’s no sincerity in it, there’s no understanding to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "33.1.n Now, we don’t want to take communion like that.\n",
      "33.2.n That’s the same thing has become to the Lord’s table.\n",
      "\n",
      "34.1.n Isaiah 35 …\n",
      "34.2.n No, I beg your pardon.\n",
      "34.3.n Isaiah 60 …\n",
      "34.4.n Let me take that back.\n",
      "34.5.n I believe it’s Isaiah 28, is where we find this.\n",
      "34.6.n I’m pretty sure that’s the right chapter.\n",
      "34.7.n He said, “Precept must be upon precept; and line upon line upon line; here a little, there a little.\n",
      "34.8.n Hold fast to that what’s good.\n",
      "34.9.n With stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people.\n",
      "34.10.n And this is the Rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "35.1.n He said, “All the tables of the Lord has become full of vomit.\n",
      "35.2.n Who can I teach Doctrine?\n",
      "35.3.n Who can I make to understand?”\n",
      "35.4.n See?\n",
      "35.5.n I think that was the right Scripture, Isaiah 28.\n",
      "35.6.n “Who can I make understand Doctrine?”\n",
      "35.7.n See, “the tables.”\n",
      "\n",
      "36.1.n Now, we find out today that this great thing that we’re fixing to do tonight, in commemoration of His death and His Body that we believe that we eat daily, or, just got through eating as our brother preached to us.\n",
      "36.2.n Taking the Word of God, we believe It with all of our heart.\n",
      "36.3.n We see It manifested; we see It given to us; we see It vindicated; we feel It in our lives.\n",
      "36.4.n And we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we’re doing, not just because it’s an order.\n",
      "\n",
      "37.1.n You go into church, and many times they give out an old soda cracker or some kind of a something, break it up, and light bread or something, and break it up; and people who smoke, drink, everything else, because they’re a member of the church they come and take the Lord’s supper.\n",
      "37.2.n Well, that’s filthiness before God!\n",
      "\n",
      "38.1.n Even the sacrifice, said, “Your holy days and your sacrifice become a stench in My nose.”\n",
      "38.2.n Yet He ordained them to make that sacrifice.\n",
      "38.3.n But the way they treated it, it become a stench, stink in His nose (His nostrils), the very sacrifice that He ordained.\n",
      "\n",
      "39.1.n That’s the way we take the Word of God, too many Christians today (so-called) does that.\n",
      "39.2.n We stand up here and teach this Word, and say, “Jesus Christ isn’t the same yesterday, today, and forever,” and teach the things that He promised us that He would honor, and say, “Oh, well, that was for something else,” our solemn worships just become a stink in His nose.\n",
      "39.3.n He will not receive it, by no means.\n",
      "39.4.n That’s the reason, by our traditional habits!\n",
      "\n",
      "40.1.n You don’t take the Lord’s supper by a tradition.\n",
      "40.2.n You take it because it’s the love of God in your heart, in keeping the commandments of God.\n",
      "40.3.n See, that’s what you take it for.\n",
      "\n",
      "41.1.n So if you don’t take it in sincerity, just it’s a tradition, “Well, our church observes communion once every Sunday, or once every month, or twice a year,” and you go up, say, “Well, it’s my time,” and then take the communion, why, it’s a stink to God!\n",
      "41.2.n See, that’s just a tradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "42.1.n Even like anything else, you’ve got to be sincere.\n",
      "42.2.n God wants the depths of your heart.\n",
      "42.3.n You remember, the very God that brought you here on earth is the One you’re serving.\n",
      "42.4.n See?\n",
      "\n",
      "43.1.n You’re doing this because He said so, because it’s His order.\n",
      "43.2.n Then we want to come up with deepness of sincerity, knowing that by God’s grace that we have been saved.\n",
      "43.3.n And we love Him and we feeled His Presence, and we see It change our lives.\n",
      "43.4.n Our whole being is changed.\n",
      "43.5.n We’re different people.\n",
      "43.6.n We don’t live like we used to, we don’t think like we used to.\n",
      "\n",
      "44.1.n Like in the Book here, and the spot there we was talking about the two Books being One, the Book of Life.\n",
      "44.2.n The first Book of life coming up, was when you were born, that was your natural birth.\n",
      "44.3.n See?\n",
      "44.4.n But then one time, way back down in there, there was a little grain of Life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon.\n",
      "44.5.n See, there’s a little grain of Life laying there, that you wonder, “Where did It come from?\n",
      "44.6.n What these strange things?”\n",
      "\n",
      "45.1.n I was saying this, taking for myself, like you was going to say, “William Branham, well, forty years ago, the William Branham, it isn’t the same one tonight.”\n",
      "45.2.n If somebody back there would say, “William Branham, he was a rank rascal,” see, because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham.\n",
      "45.3.n In their nature I was a sinner, I came to the world, a liar, and all the habits of the world laid right in me.\n",
      "45.4.n But down in there, too, was another Nature present, see, predestinated, was in there by God.\n",
      "45.5.n In this same body, see, two natures in there.\n",
      "\n",
      "46.1.n Well, I only catered to one.\n",

Now, we are to take it. ',\n",
       " 'We understand that Saint Paul, who ordained it in the Church, being the prophet of the New Testament. Peter, James, John, all of them, they wrote (why, Matthew, Mark, Luke) what Jesus did, as scribes. But Paul set the thing in order, he was he was the prophet of the New Testament. Just as Moses went into the wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the five Books of … the first five Books of the Bible, well, Paul also went into the desert and received inspiration from God, to set the New Testament Church in order and type It with the Old.

That’s exact. But, you see, he only recognized Jesus right there in the hour he was dying. See? That’s the only—that’s the only opportunity he had. He was a thief, he was away, he was out. And he, as soon as he seen that Light, he recognized It, “Lord, remember me!” And Jesus … That was true. ',\n",
       " 'But to you and I who know that we should be baptized, and refuse to do it, then that’ll be between you and God. Same thing in communion! ',\n",

You’ve got to live a life that … before the people, that … and before God and the people, that shows that you are—that you are sincere. ',\n",
       " 'Now, just a moment longer. Now, in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a statute or an ordinance. And so is water baptism an ordinance; so is feet-washing an ordinance; so is the Lord’s supper an ordinance. “Blessed is he that does all of His ordinance, keeps all of His statutes, all of His commandments, that he might have a right to enter into the Tree of Life.” ',\n",
       " 'Now, notice in this now, that in that first, when it was first an ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church, and to the temple and the altar, and offer your gift, and for your sins, the sacrifice of a lamb. Well, I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road, knowing that he was guilty, and he goes to the altar; or brings his fat ox or a bullock, or whatever he had, or a ram, lamb, something. He had brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come, he walked up there, keeping God’s ordinance just as sincerely as he could. ',\n",
       " 'Then he laid his hands upon it, confessing his sins, and the priest placing this (his sins) upon the lamb, and the lamb’s throat was cut, and then died for him. As he laid there, the little lamb kicking and bleeding, his hands being full of blood, and it flying all over him, (the little lamb blatting, dying), he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place. Therefore, he was offering this lamb’s death for his death. See, the lamb died in his place. Then the man done it with sincerity, with deepness of his heart. ',\n",

And then here he come down, “Well, let’s see, this is so-and-so today, maybe I better go down. Yeah, I better offer a bullock.” He went down, “Well, Lord, here’s my bullock.” See, there’s no sincerity in it, there’s no understanding to it. ',\n",

We stand up here and teach this Word, and say, “Jesus Christ isn’t the same yesterday, today, and forever,” and teach the things that He promised us that He would honor, and say, “Oh, well, that was for something else,” our solemn worships just become a stink in His nose. He will not receive it, by no means. That’s the reason, by our traditional habits! ',\n",

The first Book of life coming up, was when you were born, that was your natural birth. See? But then one time, way back down in there, there was a little grain of Life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon.

In their nature I was a sinner, I came to the world, a liar, and all the habits of the world laid right in me.

And, oh, my, drinking, and parties, and carrying on; it made me sick, I’d take my lantern and my dog and go to the woods, to stay all night. In the wintertime I’d hunt till the party was over, maybe daylight in the morning. Come home, wouldn’t be over, I’ve laid on top of a shed and sleep, waiting for daylight to break. ',\n",

It was froze five inches deep in the ground. But, little flower, where did you come from?” See? “Well, and where’d you come from? Who come out here and planted you? And what hothouse did they bring you out of? Or what about it, where’d you come from?” See? That little flower, I’d say, “Why, it was froze, and everything, and I built a fire on top here.
