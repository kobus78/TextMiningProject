Thank you, Brother Vayle. [Blank spot on tape.] Good evening, friend. It’s a privilege to be here tonight. This is my second time to be here in this Grantway Assembly, with my dear brother, Mack, and all this fine staff here, and the joining Christians from different churches, Brother Lee Vayle. And I just met a brother here, that, a bosom friend to Brother F. F. Bosworth, and didn’t even know Brother Bosworth had gone on to meet the Lord. I said, “I feel like I met the Elisha that poured water on Elijah’s hands,” when they had been abroad and didn’t know that Brother Bosworth had gone on to meet the Lord, at eighty-four years old. 
Thank you, Brother Green. It’s a privilege. A greeting to Brother and Sister Green, and all that’s here this morning. And it is a privilege that I feel I have given to me, to come to this place of worship, to make a few announcements. I don’t want to take Brother Green’s time here, because I heard Brother Green several times, speak, and I certainly was influenced, and as he brought the Word of the Lord to us, and so humble about it. Yesterday he said, “I don’t get the Word from the Lord as maybe It would come in revelation, as It’s been sent, but,” said, “I like to stress upon what has been said.” 
I canceled a hunting trip, so I keep service to the Lord. So it’s a … We’re glad to be here. I believe, the last time here, I told you: each time we come, there is someone missing. And if we shall come back next year, and the Lord tarries, there’ll be somebody missing. There’s one, was very, very close to me in heart, spirit; that was Brother Lyle. 
Minister brothers, and you friends out there, I say it’s a privilege to be here this morning. Such an introduction as that, why, I don’t know how I’m ever going to live up to that one. But just setting there talking, Brother Noel and I, I don’t believe I’ve ever met a person just exactly … We all are made in different molds, but by the same God. Like Brother Jack Moore, he’s certainly been … Brother Noel was just saying, “Since I’ve been here with him … ” 
You be seated. It’s good to be back again tonight. Thankful we have this opportunity again now to serve the Lord. And after keeping you so long last night, I feel it wouldn’t be fair to keep you long again tonight. Just back there listening to an associate brother of ours, in the Lord, that just come from Indiana, stirred by a strange dream. He’s never be in Shreveport before, in his life. 
Let’s bow our heads. Dear Lord, we thank Thee tonight for the promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus, where we’ll meet in a great meeting where it’ll never end, of joys and songs, as we praise You through the—the ceaseless ages that is to come. We ask Your blessings upon the meeting tonight. 
Let’s bow our heads. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight because that You answer prayer for us. This poor dear woman laying there, where surgery has failed. But, O God, we remember the first surgery was ever performed in the earth, You did it Yourself. You taken from the side of Adam, a rib, closed up the incision, and made a wife. O Father, I pray tonight that Your hand will come down now and will perform this great thing that we’re asking for.
