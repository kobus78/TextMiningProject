Thank you, Brother Vayle. [Blank spot on tape.] Good evening, friend. It’s a privilege to be here tonight. This is my second time to be here in this Grantway Assembly, with my dear brother, Mack, and all this fine staff here, and the joining Christians from different churches, Brother Lee Vayle. And I just met a brother here, that, a bosom friend to Brother F. F. Bosworth, and didn’t even know Brother Bosworth had gone on to meet the Lord. I said, “I feel like I met the Elisha that poured water on Elijah’s hands,” when they had been abroad and didn’t know that Brother Bosworth had gone on to meet the Lord, at eighty-four years old. Now I want to greet the folks who is on the telephone hookup tonight, across the country, all the way from California to New York, and Texas and up different parts of the nation, from Maine to California. So, we got a system of hooking up these telephones, that’s been a great blessing. And now we understand, through our good friend, Brother Pearry Green, that they’ve got a little gadget they can put on your television set, and not only will it be on the telephone but it will be televised right in your television set, also. And they’re seeing about it now. And, Sister Mack, I’m glad to see you looking fine, sitting here at the organ, tonight. And many of my friends I see from down at Sierra Vista, and Brother Borders … or Brother Roberson, rather, from Indiana; many. I want to say to the folks up at the tabernacle, tonight, look like half of them is down here, and from the tabernacle at Jeffersonville. And to my friend up there, Brother Kuhn, that you called in about, concerning that sick, request. I’m praying for it, Brother Kuhn. Just have faith. Don’t worry. It’ll be all right. And down into Texas, Brother Blair, if you are listening in tonight, my brother, just remember this; that God Who brought you through the first time, can bring you through the second. And we are believing that God will grant this to you. And don’t you take the devil’s lie about anything. You just remember that God is God, and there is … and He still remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we love Him and believe Him, and we are praying for you. To all of our friends in California; to Brother Mercier and them up here in Arizona, many other places, Phoenix; and Brother Williams, and you all are hooked up up there tonight, all around, we are certainly grateful; and down in Georgia. And we are certainly thankful for every one of you. The Lord bless you. I have a feeling of real welcome here tonight, in this fine church, the Assembly of God here on Grantway, and with Brother Mack, my good friend. God has blessed Brother Mack. I remember one time in Canada, that he was … I was riding back a trail, on a horse, way back into the jungles, and the Holy Spirit spoke to me to get off and pray for Brother Mack. At that time he was in emergency, and the Lord healed him. And so I’m so thankful for that, and to be assembled here tonight with him, to worship the Lord in this fine Truth. A man sitting on the platform, behind me, said, “Don’t guess you know me.” Said, “One time you picked me up, as a hitchhiker,” and, I don’t know, somewhere up in Boston or somewhere, “Detroit, hitchhiking.” And I said, “Well, I usually try to have a hand out, if I can, for those who are needy.” And so, tonight, we’re all needy. And we pray that God will give us a hand tonight, of help, of blessings, and of His grace and mercy. Now, I’m kind of prone to speaking a long time, but I’ll try not to do that tonight. Cause, the people up in Ohio just called, Mrs. Dauch and the group up there, Brother McKinney and Brother Brown, and all them hooked in through Ohio. We send you greetings, also. It’s late up in New York, and I suppose it’s about eleven or twelve o’clock, at this time, in New York. And the churches come and waited till this hour, just for the service. We are grateful for those fine friends around everywhere. Now before we open the Word, let’s just speak to the Author, a moment, while we bow our heads. Dear Heavenly Father, we are … our hearts are overjoyed, for the privilege that we have of being alive here tonight, and assembled together with Your people. The people … and who we believe to live forever. We now possess Eternal Life, because, “You gave Your only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting Life.” In His pilgrimage here on the earth, He taught us, “He that heareth My Word and believeth on Him that sent Me, has everlasting Life; and shall not come into the judgment, but has passed from death unto Life, because we believed on the only begotten Son of God.” How we thank You for this great Saviour! And we pray, tonight, that His great Presence will so bless us together here, as we read of His Word and speak on It. Let the Holy Spirit take that to each heart throughout the nation, Lord, wherever people are gathered together. Bless other ministers who are in the pulpit. We pray, Father, that You will bless this Grantway Assembly; its pastor, his wife, his children; the deacons, trustees, and all the board. And, Father, together may we work for the Kingdom of God, while it’s enough Light to see where we’re getting around, for the hour is coming when no man can work. And, Father, while we have this privilege, may we redeem the time, Lord. May we, that be granted to us. Heal the sick and the afflicted throughout the land. May the Presence of God be felt in every crack and corner of the nation, tonight. We realize that judgment is striking. Great faults are falling in, and the nation is shaking, and earthquakes in divers places. Great historical things that we’ve heard of in the days past, of judgment, through the Bible, and we see it repeating again today. The prophecy saying, “As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man. As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man,” and we see it happening now. “Man’s hearts failing; perplexity of time; distress between nations.” God, we know we’re at the end time. Help us, Lord, to take the Message to every crack and corner, to every child that You’ve ordained to Life. Grant it, Lord. We ask it in Jesus’ Name. Amen. Lord, bless the reading now of His Word. Now many of you like to kind of look into the Bible, where a minister is reading. And I want to read tonight, a couple, three verses out of the Psalms, Psalm 42, just for the way of having a text. And I’ve got some Scriptures written out here, and I want to refer to them, if I can, as we go along in the next few minutes, to speak on this subject. The Psalm of David. David wrote the Psalms. Now while you’re turning, I might say this. Many people say, “Well, is the Psalms inspired?” Certainly, they are. They’re … Anything that’s in this Bible is inspired, whether it’s history, whether it’s songs, whatever it is. It’s inspired. Jesus said, “Have not you read what David said in the Psalms?” And then I think, Psalms, of course, is songs. And if songs are inspired of God, which, I believe they are, and prophetic also, I hope I am standing that day when this song comes to pass. There is going to be a meeting in the air, In that sweet, sweet by and by; Going to meet you, and greet you over there; In that Home beyond the sky; Such singing ever heard, ever heard by mortal ears, It’ll be glorious, I do declare! And God’s Own Son will be the leading One At that meeting in the air. Oh, I want to be there at that time! Now Psalm 42. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night, while my … while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? I think, David, in the writing of this Psalm, must have been in distress. And it usually takes distress to bring the best out of a man. It, really, that’s when God … gets down to when we fast, many times, to get ourself in position to get ourself out of the way. And I think, when David got in these places, then he begin to meditate on the Lord, begin to think about the things. Many times, God gets us in tight corners where we have to look up. Sometimes we even have to get on our back in the hospital, or a bed somewhere, so we can look up to see where the great blessings of God comes from. Now the word I want to speak from tonight, one word out of the Bible, and that is found in the 2nd verse, “thirst,” the word: Thirst. I was looking in the dictionary when I was looking up this word. I was thinking about a sermon one time, I preached on Thirsting After Life. And I took it out of the Psalms, too, when David said, “Thy statutes,” I believe, “are more precious to me than life.” Then I was looking and thinking about that word “thirst,” so I looked up in the dictionary, to see what it means. And here is what Webster says, “It’s a painful desire,” a painful, when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you. Now, it’s not an unnatural thing, to thirst. Thirst is a natural thing. It’s just simply something that God has given us, that we could, to give us a desire for something. Sometimes God has, also, has given you a control tower, something that sets inside of you, that controls these different desires. And this thirst, this control tower that sets in a man’s heart, is something that God give him to warn him of the desires that’s needful for him. Now there is two different kinds of thirst. There is a thirst, physically. And there is a thirst, also, spiritually. I would like to read this, what David said, again. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God: … Not some historical, or some something that happened some years ago, or some tale that someone told; but, “for the living God,” a God that’s ever present. And his soul thirsted for that God, not for some historical something. Now we find, God gives the control tower to you, to give to you the things that you need. Now, the control tower in you is what directs you. And this thirst runs in on this co- … tower, control tower, and tells you what you have need of, spiritually speaking. The control tower in the body, and in the soul, also. There is a control tower in the body, that tells you the need that’s needed in your body, and it’s brought to you by thirst. Also, there is a control tower in your soul, that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of, something in your spirit, and, and you by this can tell what kind of a life is controlling you. When you can see what your desires are, then you can tell, by that, what kind of something that’s in you, that’s creating this desire that you have. See, there is a certain thing that you thirst for, and it can tell you in your soul what this desire is, by the nature of the thirst that you have. I hope that you can understand that. There is a control tower of the soul, and one for the body, and each tower is a warning caller for the needs of the other. Each one calls to the need for what the caller is calling for, it sends out a wave of warning. For instance, the flesh thirst to satisfy the desires that’s in the body, and the spirit desires for the things that’s in the soul, desire is, and many times these war one against the other. We find there, what’s a great trouble today, that too many people try to live between those two desires. For, one of them desires the things of the earth, the other desires the things of Heaven. Like Paul said, describes as in Romans 7:21, “When I would do good, then evil is nigh.” When you try, did you ever have that in experience, Christians? That when you’re trying to do something that’s worth-while, go to make an effort to do something that’s good, then you find out that there is the devil, on every hand, just to upset you, everything that you’d … And that’s one good thing, that. I’d like to say this, that the Christians might know. That when you are starting to do something, and there is something always trying to upset you in doing it, do it anyhow. That’s the devil there, trying to keep you from doing what’s right. Now, many times, I meet people that’s prone to be a little nervous. When they find out that they’re trying to do something, and everything is just blocking it off on both sides, they say, “It might not been the will of the Lord.” See? Now don’t let the devil lie to you like that. The first thing, is find out whether it’s the will of God, or not. And then if you want to know whether it’s the will of God, look into the Bible. There is the thing that sets you straight, is the Word of God; and then if you see it’s in the Word of God, for you to do it. Like, for instance, seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Many times, I’ve run into people, say, “Well, I have sought for the Holy Ghost, and I just couldn’t receive It. I don’t believe It’s for me. Every time I get down, I get sick. And I go to praying, if I fast, I get sick. And if I try to stay all night, I stay up, I get so sleepy. I can’t get off my feet.” Remember, that is the devil. Because, God intends for you to have the Holy Spirit. It’s for whosoever will. Many times you find, when you’re prayed for, in a meeting, for Divine healing, then the next day you find out, no doubt, that the devil will make that twice as bad as it was the day before. See? Remember, that’s just Satan trying to get you away from the blessing that God has got for you. See? Don’t you listen to that fellow. See? Always press right on. I had an experience with that just recently on the road to Africa. If I ever had any time that the devil ever did press at me, was to go to Africa this last time. It become one of the finest meetings and times that I ever went overseas. I got, I believe, more things accomplished in that little time that I was there, besides my hunting trip, than I ever did at any time. I had always thought that those churches didn’t want me there, and come to find out … I had a letter from someone, that it was, oh, they didn’t want me there, all the association; and found out it was one man, with a letterhead from an organization, that said, “We don’t want you,” he meant him and his family. See? So then when I got over there … See, just “we,” that was he and his family; and it wasn’t the people, at all. So, now it’s a great field opened up for us. You see, when Paul said, “When I would do good, then evil is nigh.” You let a young convert come tonight to the altar, somewhere here in this tabernacle, or out across the nation; and just remember, tomorrow, mother will be more angry than she ever was, dad will be all upset, and all the school kids. And everything just goes wrong, because it’s Satan trying to get you to turn around. He is trying to run you off the Path. “When I would do good, then evil is always nigh.” Now let us look at the thirst, and let’s see whether actually a thirst is a natural thing. I’ve had people to tell me, “Oh, I never did. I believe it’s just for some people to want to be Christians.” Oh, no. That’s wrong. It’s actually something that’s associated with every human being. It certainly is true. When we come to this country in the early days, we found the Indians here. And the Indians, though they were heathen at that time, they worshiped the sun or something. As long as they are human, there is something in them, a natural thirst, calling out for God, somewhere. Back in the jungles, just recently back there, four hundred and eighty miles from the closest civilization, a little, small town of about three thousand people, of Beira, in Mozambique. We found natives that didn’t even … never seen a white person. I found a native girl, she had no clothes on, (any of them hardly have clothes on), and she was sitting up in a tree. And I was tracking the lion, and there was … I heard something like a human being, screaming. This native girl sitting up there, walleyed, holding a baby. And what she was scared about … That’s her only protection, is get up a tree, from a lion, leopard or something, or some animal. And she had seen me, and heard it was a human being, but when she looked and seen a white person! She had never seen one in her life, see, and she was scared to death. See? But when we find those people, even in that primitive condition back there, they were still worshiping. Before we called the lion in, they poured out some mealie meal (that’s what they eat) on a little leaf, and clap their hands, and called on the spirit of some great something they didn’t know where (like a patron saint or something, to a Catholic), to protect them, that they wouldn’t be killed during the time of the charge of this lion. See, it’s something natural. It’s not an unnatural thing to thirst for God. It’s a natural thing. It’s just something that you should do. God has made you up like that. And it’s no super human, it’s just actually a common human being. It ain’t just special for some people. They say, “Well, I’ve seen some people live such a victorious life, that they’re constantly on the housetop, they’re praising God. Wish I could feel that way.” Well, the reason you are feeling that way, it’s the thirst in you. And it’s just a natural thing. It’s for every person, to thirst for God. Now we’ll take some of the natural. Thirst is first. Let’s take, for instance, thirsting for water. As David said here, thirsting for, of “the water.” Thirsting for water, the body is in need of water. And if you don’t supply that thirst, you’ll perish. You will dehydrate, and you won’t live. If you can’t get water to that thirst, to quench that thirst of the natural body you will soon perish. You won’t live long. You can live longer without food than you can without water. Because, you can fast for forty days (Jesus did), I suppose, without food, but you couldn’t do that long without water. You would just simply dry up and die. You must have water. And the thirst that comes on you, why, it’s to show that the body is in need of something, to keep it alive. The body has got to have the water, in order to stay alive. You are eighty-something percent of water and petroleum, anyhow, and you’ve got to take these sources in, to keep you alive. As I have said, if you neglect it you’ll perish. The thirst also is an alarm. It’s an alarm clock, that thirsting. The soul sets off alarm clock, a little buzzer inside of you that tells you that death has lurking nigh. That, if you don’t get water pretty soon, you’ve got to die. And it gets louder and louder, until finally you keep putting it off and you’ll die, because it’s an alarm clock. Like David described it here in the Psalms, “As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.” As the hart panteth after the water brook! I’ve often thought, as reading of this of David. David was a woodsman, a hunter. And he hunted deer, of course. And many of we, in this day, hunt them. The hart is a deer. And we find, if you ever seen the dogs, the wild dogs will grab a deer. And usually they got, like the coyote, a fang. And he can grab the deer right above the burr of the ear, here, and swing his weight. He cuts the throat of the deer, and the deer doesn’t have a chance then. But sometimes the dog, like in Africa there, the wild dog will grab the deer right in the flanks, if he misses the throat. He’ll grab, the second time, at the flank. And if the deer is strong enough and quick enough, he can shake the dog off. The deer is much faster. The dog stalks him when he’s not looking, and when he is up wind from him, and he don’t know the dog is near. And then, when the wild dog grabs him, if he’s real quick, he can throw it off. And, but when the dog comes out of the flank, he has got a whole mouthful of the deer’s flesh. Or, when he grabs at his neck sometimes, he’ll cut close to the jugular vein, and miss it. And the deer, shaking him, will pull a whole chunk of meat out of the deer’s throat, then the blood begins to run. And then the dog will come right on the trail of that blood, after the deer. And as the life of the deer begins to dwindle, as the blood, which is the life stream to the body, as that begins to dwindle down, the deer gets weaker. And the dog then, or the wolf, is right behind the deer. Now, if that deer can’t find water! Now, water has something in it, that, when the deer drinks the water, it stops the bleeding. But if he don’t get water to cool him off, then the blood keeps flowing out faster; because he is running, keeping his heart pumping. But if he can ever get to water, the deer will live. Now there is a great lesson there, see, and David saying here, “As the hart panteth for the water brook, my soul panteth for Thee, O God.” Now that deer knows, unless he finds water he’s gone. He just can’t live. I have tracked them many times after being wounded. When he hits a stream of water, he will cross in and get a drink, go up over the hill; come back down, cross, get a drink of water and go up. You’ll never catch up with him, as long as he’ll follow that stream. But once when he leaves the stream, if he can’t find another water brook somewhere, you’ll catch him right away. And now the deer knows that, so he’ll stay right with the water, where he can get to it right quick. Now could you imagine a deer with his nose up, he has been caught out somewhere where there is no water? And he says, “As the hart thirsts or panteth (is a thirst) after the water brooks, my soul thirsts after Thee, O God. Unless I can find You, Lord, I’ll perish. I can’t go unless I find You! And when a man or woman, boy or girl, gets that kind of a thirst for God, he is going to find something. See? But when we come at it, just kind of halfway, “Well, I’ll kneel down and see what the Lord does.” See, you’re not really thirsting yet. It’s got to be a thirst between death and Life, and then something takes place. The deer, also here he’s … We find that he also has another sense, of smell, that sets off an alarm in him when his enemy is near. He is possessed, this little creature, with a sense to protect himself. And he’s got a little alarm in him, a little something, that he tickles his nose when the enemy is near. You can get in the wind of the enemy, and he knows that you’re there, and he is gone. Sometimes a half a mile away, he can smell you and get away, or the wolf or any danger. He is able to sense it because that he is made up that way. He is a deer, by nature. And that sense in him is just one that God give him, senses to him, to live by. And I thought, comparing the deer with a man that’s thirsting for God, before the enemy gets there. There is something about a child of God, that when you once are born into the Spirit of God, receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, there is something about the person that can sense the enemy. You can take a man when he’s taking the Scripture, and reading the Scripture and try to inject something to that Scripture, that’s contrary to the Scripture, a man that’s filled with the Holy Ghost can [Brother Branham snaps his finger.] sense that, right quick. There is something out of the way. When he gets into a place, and that little certain sense in there, that it’s done to protect your life. You, you mustn’t, you mustn’t never go for anything unless it’s exactly the Word of God. You must stay right exactly with that Word. And, now, and we are secured with that sense as long as we are in the Holy Spirit. You can go to read, and like for instance, somebody say, and I go to read in Mark 16, and say, “And these signs shall follow them that believe: In My Name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; or take up serpents, or drink deadly things, it would not harm them; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.” Now, then, you find a person get up there and say, “Now, that was for the apostolic age.” That, now, right quick, if you have received the Holy Spirit, you’ve been endowed with that sense. It sets it off. There is something wrong there. See? They try to explain it away, that it’s for another day, that really you don’t need those things today. But Jesus said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” See, there is a little something sets off in you, a little buzzer, in knowing that that’s wrong and that’s the way of death. Cause, Jesus said, “If we add one word to This, or take one Word from It, our part is taken out of the Book of Life.” See, not one Scripture. We must take It just the way It’s written. And God watches over His Word, to perform It, and we know that It’s got to be just right. So therefore, no matter what a church would say, what anyone else would say, if you’re born of the Spirit of God, you become part of the Bible. God told Ezekiel, he, the prophet. He said, “Take the scroll and eat it,” then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other. And that’s the believer when he receives the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible, and the Spirit of God is the Word of God. “My Words are Spirit. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Hebrews 13:8, “He is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” And when you are a part of that Word, oh, then let something come up contrary to that Word, [Brother Branham snaps his finger.] there is a little buzzer sets off right quick. See, It’s to warn you that death is in the road. We should never do that. There is also … These thirsts are just natural. They are natural for the Christian. They are natural for the human being. There is also a thirst for success. So many people today, how we school for this thirst! We just noticed, they started the university up. And we go down there, and people spend thousands of dollars to send their children to the school, and to universities and colleges, and so forth, to get an education, “To be successful,” they call it, “in life.” But now I have nothing against that, now, that’s all right. But, to me, you could get all the schooling in the world, and still you haven’t found the right success. That’s right. Because, that will just temporarily make things a little easier for you here. And there is … But when you die, you leave all that behind you, and this entire economy that we have. I was saying it the other day, at Phoenix. It stand quoting again, that, “All this modern civilization, the whole educational program, the whole scientific program, is all contrary to God’s Word and His will.” Civilization is absolutely … There will never be a civilization in the world that is to come, like this one. This is a perverted civilization. God had His first civilization upon the earth, when He spoke His Words and they come up, every seed of its kind, and in that civilization there was no death, sickness, sorrow. And now we take the things that is in the scientific world, that was put here to hold it together, and pervert it into something, and that brings death. Like the atomic bomb. I don’t know the formulas of these things, but I might say this wrong. They take uranium, to split a molecule, and a molecule breaks into atoms. What does it do then? It just annihilates, almost, just destroys. Everything that we do! We take medicine, put this formula with this formula, to cure this, and put it into us. And what do we do? We tear down something else. Now I guess you read, read last month’s Reader’s Digest, that it said that, “In this age that we’re living in now, that, young men and women may reach middle age between twenty and twenty-five years old.” Think of that. Little girls in menopause, and twenty, and twenty-two and twenty-three years old, middle age. You see, what’s done it, it’s been this hybrid food and stuff we’re eating. See, it’s the stuff, the food and the life that we’re living. Scientists has brought it to us, and, in doing so, they’re killing you. I was in Africa where I’d see them boys that never had a dose of medicine in their life. They eat meat that had maggots in it. They drank out of a pool that it looked like would kill an ox. And I was shooting a target at two hundred yards, and I couldn’t see it with a pair of seven-fifty binoculars. And a man my age was standing there, telling me where it was hit, with his naked eye. Now, if all this modern culture has done something … I feel if I had his eyes and his stomach, I would be a pretty good man. Yeah. But there you are, you see, that’s what science, education, civilization, we’re destroyed by it. We destroy ourselves. It started in the garden of Eden, and runs on for today. But, thirsting for success! Then, we thirst for fellowship. We go, we want fellowship. It’s like a young man and a young woman. Now, it’s not unnecessary or not (I mean) unnatural for a young man and a young woman to love one another. It is a thirst for love. It’s their age, and they love one another. And it’s not unnatural, that’s just a natural thing for them to do that. Now we find many things, in the life that we live in the natural body, that we thirst for. It’s just something sets in us. We want to do it, we absolutely feel that it’s necessary. And it is necessary that we do it. We find many women, in these days, thirst for beauty. Now there isn’t a woman … It’s a natural thing for a woman to thirst to be pretty. That’s her God-given instinct and her beauty that God give her for her mate. And now we find out that women want to be that way. Why is it? It’s just because it’s something God gave her. And it’s not wrong for women to be pretty. They should be. And, you know, they are the only creature that the female is prettier than the male, it’s in the human race. Every other animal, take the cow to the bull, the doe deer to the buck, the hen to the rooster, the mother bird to the father bird, always you find the male is big and pretty. But on the human race, showed there is where the perversion come, it turns around; and it’s the women so is pretty, and they lust to be pretty. Not like some of these weird creatures we see on the street of this day; no, no, not that kind of pretty. No. That’s the horriblest-looking sight I ever seen in my life. Yes, sir. That is the perversion that’s perverting the true thirst. Now, the true thirst that a woman should have, would be to “adorn themselves in modest apparel, and to have a Christlike spirit,” First Timothy 2:9. Now that’s a way the woman should thirst to be. Now if you want to be pretty, that’s the way what makes you pretty, see, is a Christlike spirit, and adorned in modest apparel. Oh, my, some of these people today out on the streets! You can’t tell a man from the woman, and it’s the most horrible-looking thing that you would … I wouldn’t, it’s … I never seen anything like it, like human beings. It’s beyond human. Eyes painted way up like that, and, you know, them funny-looking lizard eyes, and all them funny-looking clothes. And, why, it don’t even … All so out of form, they don’t even look like a human being. And some of them boys out here, with their hair combed down, their sister’s, rollers in front here, you know, why, it’s a complete perversion! That’s right. It’s Satan, and Satan is the perverter. When God made everything in the garden of Eden, it was lovely, then Satan come in and perverted. Satan cannot create nothing. There is only one Creator, that’s God. But Satan perverts the original creation. And now he’s got into (this I want to speak tonight about) perverting the original creation of thirst. Now, a woman, as I said before, wants to be pretty. There is something in her, that she is feminish and she wants to be that way. But the way they are on the street today, hair cut like a man, wearing men’s clothes; and then men turn around, wearing women’s clothes, and a haircut like a woman. See, it’s a perversion, the whole thing! Your food is perverted. Your life is perverted. Your thirst, perverted. Your desire is perverted. It’s a day of perversion! I was speaking here, not long ago, on Satan’s Eden. God took six thousand years, and made a perfect Eden. Satan come over and sprayed them seeds, and deformed them. Now he’s got six thousand years, and he has got his own scientific Eden, right back again on a perversion of the right. And this is the age of hybreeding, hybreeding. They even have got the churches today, till they’re hybrid. That’s right. They get in here, they just go to church, it’s a lodge instead of a church. A church is a place where people come together and worship God in Spirit and in Truth. And today it’s a lodge. We go there and have a little time to shake hands, and fellowship, and some black coffee in the back of the building, and go home till next week, and we done our religious duty. Now it’s a perverted age. And Satan is perverting these thirsts that God put in you, to thirst. Satan is perverting them. Now if you want to know the right, perversion … If you, the women, wants to be pretty, take First Timothy 2:9, that’s that “adorning themselves in modest apparel, with a Christlike spirit, meek, subject to their husbands,” and so forth. That’s the way that you should be adorned, your life you live. He perverts the true nature of God, and the true thirst of God, of the body and soul, by lust for sin. Sin, a perversion! Now we find out, a person today, the way they’ve took that perversion; thirst for God, the thirst for to be pretty, and all these thirsts. For, for water, they’ve turned that into satisfying that with drinking. The thirst for joy, everybody wants to have joy; thirst for fellowship; all these great thirsts that God put into us, that we might thirst after Him. God made you to thirst after Him, and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of a thirst, with some other kind of a perversion of the correct thirst. See how it’s in the natural? See how it’s in the spiritual? We think, as long as we join church, that settles, that’s all we have to do. Well, that is absolutely wrong. No. God wants you to thirst for Him! “As the hart panteth for the water brook, my soul thirsts after Thee, O God.” See? See? Now, if that deer was panting for the water brook, what if somebody come along, and another buddy deer could come along, and say, “Say, I’ll tell you what I could do. I know where there is a mud hole down here.” Well, the deer wouldn’t want that. He, that wouldn’t do him any good. And there is nothing can satisfy that thirst that’s in the human being, until God comes in. He must have It, or die. And no persons has a right to try to hush or satisfy that holy thirst, that’s in him, by the things of the world. No, sir. It’s ungodly to do so. And if you thirst for God, don’t shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book. If you’re thirsting for God, there is only one thing to satisfy it, that’s, meet God. If you’re thirsting for God, that’s the only way you can meet Him, is to do that. And then there is a great danger, also, if you don’t watch what you’re doing in that time. If you’re thirsting for God, be sure it’s God you find. See, be sure that it’s your thirst is satisfied. But if Satan has been able to pervert you, from these natural appetites, and that he’ll do if he can, he’ll simply make you try to be satisfied. A man get out, what makes a man gets drunk? Is because he is worried and tore up. There is something lacking in him. I was at Mayo’s, here not long ago, and I was up there on an interview. And then it was told in this, that, talking about drinking, and I told them that my father drank. Said, “What made him drink? I said, “I don’t know.” He said, “Is because that there was something that (he) wasn’t satisfying him, and he thought he could drink to throw it off his mind.” I caught it right then, see. It was really God, was the only thing can satisfy that thirst. God Himself is the only thing can satisfy that human thirst, is to accept God. Now Satan takes these things, as I said, and perverts them. Then if you’re … If you won’t give that thirst the right place in your life, and won’t thirst and take the things that God provided to stop that thirst with, to quench it, then Satan will lead you to some of his stagnant cesspools of this world. You must have it somewhere. If you can’t find food, you’d eat from a garbage can. See? And if you couldn’t find water, and you was dying, you’d drink out of a pool of any kind, because you are perishing. But there is no reason for that, when you’re thirsting for God, because God is a living God, not some historical something. “My soul thirsts for Thee, the living God,” Something that gives living waters, Something that satisfies. There is another nature, natural, just a natural thirst, in that thirst of the soul. You might say, “Brother Branham, is that soul thirst, is that natural?” Yes, that’s natural for a soul to thirst. And it’s, for God made you this way, that so that you would thirst for Him. He wants you to thirst after Him. Now, God made you like that. He didn’t have to make you like that, but He did do it. And if He hadn’t have made you like that, so that you would thirst, there would be an excuse at the Judgment Bar, say, “I never did thirst for God.” But, there is no excuse, you do. You will make it somewhat; you might make it your wife, you might make it your car, you might make it something else, you might go to church and try to satisfy it. And I have nothing against going to church, but that isn’t the satisfaction. It’s to find God, the living God, the God of Heaven, into your soul, that satisfies that longing and thirsting that you long for. Now, for, He made you so you could thirst for Him, for His fellowship. Now, there is genuine thirst for fellowship. Now we like to meet with one another. We’re doing that tonight. We meet here together tonight because we like to fellowship, one with the other. Why do we do that? Because there is something in us that we want to meet one another. That’s just natural. And now we meet on a common ground here, that is, because we are all thirsting for God. See? And then we meet here on this regular, common grounds here of fellowship. In the church tonight, here, might be many different denominational views, and so forth; but when it comes to that thirst, we can meet on a common ground, one ground: we all thirst. Some might believe in sprinkling, the other one in baptism, and one in pouring, or so forth; but when it comes to the thirst for God, we come on one mutual ground. And God made us so that we would do that, thirst for Him and for His fellowship. I don’t know anything … When I was a little boy, I remember I was raised in a real poor family. And I remember of many times I would go out with fellows. I couldn’t dress like to go out to a decent place. But, I don’t know, there is something about people, that I liked. I liked to get with them. But I was, more or less, what is called, the black sheep. And when I got saved and found that Something in me, that I thirsted for, a Friend, Somebody that would be a buddy to me, Somebody I could trust, Somebody you can set down to and talk your troubles over with. And when … I found that real true satisfaction when I found Jesus Christ, that real true Satisfier that takes away all … quenches all that thirst, and gives you Something that just looks like that there is just nothing to take His place. And now how Satan tries to pervert this satisfying of the soul, that thirst for the soul! He tries to give you everything to satisfy it. And he is so deceitful in these days of perversion. This is a perverted world. It’s a perverted race. It’s a perverted people. Everything is perverted, and has perverted so gradual until it’s become the most deceitful age that we’ve … any human being ever lived in. It’s more deceitful than it ever was. Now you just can’t imagine of how deceitful the nation’s got, even with our own brethren, like American people. I was speaking sometime ago. I was in the woods a few weeks ago and found a cigarette pack laying in the woods. And it said on there, “A thinking man’s filter.” And I went on down through the woods a little ways, and I come back; kept bearing on my mind, “A thinking man’s filter, and a smoking man’s taste.” Well, I was at the World Fair, couple years ago, remember when they had that Yul Brynner and all them over there, when they was making demonstrations of cigarettes. And how they took that smoke and put it across a piece of marble, and took a Q-tip and raked up that nicotine off of there, and put it on the back of a rat. In seven days, he had so much cancer he couldn’t get up on his feet. See, from one cigarette! And then they showed how that when that goes into the human lung. Some of them say, “I don’t inhale. I just puff it in my mouth.” Shows how it gets in the saliva and goes right down just the same, into the throat, see. And then this man said, “You see so much talk about a filter.” He said, “Now, if you have a desire,” there is a thirst, you see, “a desire to smoke a cigarette, one natural cigarette might satisfy that desire for the time being. But if you’ve got a filter, it takes four cigarettes to satisfy,” said, “because you’re only getting about one fourth of the smoke.” And said, “A smoking man’s taste”? See, you cannot have smoke unless you get tar. And when you got tar, you got cancer. So there you are, see, it’s just a gimmick. And I think of a tobacco company that’s in this nation, and it lives by this nation, and then with a gimmick like that, to absolutely deceive American citizens, to deceive them. A thinking man’s filter? It’s only a gimmick to sell more cigarettes. Then I thought of that thing, “A thinking man’s Filter,” I thought, “that’s a good idea.” So there is a thinking man’s Filter, that’s this Bible. A thinking man’s filter that’ll take this Filter, It’ll produce a righteous man’s taste. See? Now, you cannot pull sin through the pages of this Bible. No, It stops it. It filters it out. Now, you can go to church, and just take anything, but you can’t come through this Bible and have sin. It will not do it. It filters out all sin, and It gives a holy man’s taste. Because if the man is thinking that he wants to be holy, and be like God, and be a son or a daughter of God, then he wants the right kind of a Filter. So He stops all sin on this side the Bible, and He can only bring the Holy Spirit through the Bible, that wrote the Bible. It’s a holy man’s taste, to have this thinking man’s Filter. Now we find how deceiving it is today. Matthew 24:24, Jesus said, “In the last days, that, the two spirits would be so close alike until they would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.” How close! How, what a deception of right and wrong, we have today! Even in our government, in our politics, we haven’t even got a man that we could put up as a politician, that will absolutely stand up for what he thinks is right. Where is our Patrick Henry’s and George Washington’s, and Abraham Lincoln’s of today? Just as our President said there, “The way, if they want communism, they can have it, whatever the people wants.” If that ain’t a man that won’t speak his conviction! A man will stand on a principle, that will stand on what’s what a principle … just want to go the way of least resistance. And that’s the way that the people has got, in the church. They want to come join church, and they say, “Oh, well, that’s it, I’ve joined church now.” You are trying to satisfy that great holy thirst that God put in you, that control Tower trying to turn you to the right thing, and you try to satisfy it with joining a church, quoting a creed, or something like that. When, it’s nothing but the very Presence and filling of God Himself in your life, that will satisfy that. He won’t be satisfied with a creed. You will never pull a creed through that Bible. No. There is not even the Apostles’ Creed, so called, will never come through There. Show me in the Bible where the Apostles’ Creed says, “I believe in the Holy Roman Catholic church; I believe in the communion of saints”; when the Bible said, “There is one mediator between God and man, and that’s the Man Christ Jesus.” You will never pull that through the Bible. You will never pull all these dances, and shorts, and things that the people are doing today, these twists and watusi’s, and all these things, through God’s Word. You’ll never pull this modern trend of civilization through that Bible. It’s against it. See? And you try to satisfy that thirst, but, you see, it’ll … This Bible will only satisfy a righteous man or woman’s taste. This Holy Spirit, that they would laugh at, and said, “You’ve gone out of your mind.” But That satisfies that longing, that something that the world knows nothing about. They have perverted themselves, from true baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God, (unto what?) unto the cesspools, the cesspools of the church, of dogmas and creeds, and denominational differences, and so forth. Say, “You a Christian?” “I’m Methodist. I’m Baptist. I’m Presbyterian.” That don’t mean one thing to God, not one thing. You can’t pull them things through God’s Bible here. And you’re trying to satisfy that holy thirst that God give you, to thirst after Him. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Now, you know that David said here, “for the living God.” Now, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Then there can be no satisfaction until this Word, which is God, becomes alive in you, then you see God Himself fulfilling the promises that He made in the Bible. Now we have different interpreters of the Bible. One church interprets It this way, another one interprets It that way, and another one this way. Some don’t take but a little bit of It; some take here and there, a piece of It. But God is His Own Interpreter. When He makes a promise and fulfills it, that’s the interpretation thereof. If I promised you I would be here tonight, and here I am, that’s the fulfilling of my promise. If I say I’ll meet you in the morning, and I’m there, that’s my promise. There ain’t no need of making any other excuses, I’ve got to be there. And when God makes a promise, and then comes around and fulfills that promise, that’s the interpretation of the promise. And I would dare anybody to take God at His Word, and see if every Word in that Bible isn’t the Truth. That’s right. That’s what that thirst is in there. You say, “If I would have lived in the days of Jesus, I would have done so-and-so.” Why, you are living in His days. What are we doing about it? What are we doing? You say, “Well?” What you done, perhaps what the Pharisees done. They belonged to church, and denied Jesus Christ. We always say today, people try to say, “We compare. We’ve got to compare Bible leaf with Bible leaf, Scripture with Scripture.” That isn’t the Truth. No, it isn’t the Truth. “This Greek word means this, and this means that.” The Greeks themself, way back in the Nicaea Council, and them writers back in there, they had different forms. One believed this way, this Greek scholar meant this, and the other one said this one meant it this way. And they fussed over It. We don’t need interpretation of Greek scholars or Greek words. “To know Him is Life,” the Person, Christ Himself! Not comparing. It’s a revelation that God built His Church upon. And if we don’t build upon that same Church … The Bible said, “Abel, by faith!” And faith is a Divine revelation. See, faith is a Divine revelation. All right. This whole Thing is built upon the revelation then, and unless this is revealed to you! Jesus said, “I thank Thee, Father, that Thou has hid these things from the wise of this world, and revealed it to babes such as will learn.” See, now, the whole thing is built there, you’ve got to know the Person! And you cannot satisfy that by joining church. You’ve got to find the Person, God Himself, which is the Word and interpretation of Hisself today, the promises that He made today. The people that He was going to have in this day, “the Church without spot or wrinkle,” don’t mean a denomination; it means the persons, the individuals without spot or wrinkle. “Be two in the bed, I’ll take one and leave one; two in the field, I’ll take one and leave one.” But when God, that holy thirst to be like Him, and then you see that His Word is in you, vindicating Itself, that you are God’s servant. Whatever God says, you just toe right up to it, then you’re coming through the right process then to satisfy that holy thirst that’s in you. Oh, of course, the people will laugh at you, and say, “You’ve lost your mind. You’ve gone crazy.” But remember what they’re drinking from, see. Look where they are at. Could you imagine a big artesian well spurting up fine water, and somebody down at one of them holes down there, with dead tadpoles, and creeds, everything laying in it, drinking down there, looking up and making fun of you? Oh! Why, he doesn’t know, he doesn’t know what a thirst-quenching Stream you’re living at. That’s exactly right. We got a living God. Not one that died nineteen hundred years ago and stayed in the grave, but One that raised again. Hebrews 13:8, says, “He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever.” The same Holy Ghost that fell on the Day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that’s here now. He is the satisfying Portion, because He is the Word. That’s right. The Holy Ghost wrote the Word, He interprets the Word. The Bible said, in Second Peter, that the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible, “Men of old, moved by the Holy Ghost, wrote the Bible.” Now, you can’t do it, you can’t satisfy that holy thirst with nothing less than God Himself living in you, in the Person of the Holy Spirit. Education, culture, joining churches, reciting creeds, going to belong in a fellowship; all these things are very good, but they absolutely will not stop that holy hush, that holy thirst, rather, won’t hush that holy thirst. I was listening to Billy Graham, the great evangelist, the other night. I tell you, I pray more for him now than I ever did. I seen him really rapping it to them, the way they did. He said, “That bunch of clergymen coming down the road, them collars turned around!” Going down there where they had no business to go, sticking their nose in something. But they was going down the road, [Brother Branham claps his hands.] clapping their hands and patting their foot. Well, they looked like unholy-rollers. Now, you see, but they got something they believe in. They got something, it excites the soul. They got something they was excited about. Some woman went and stuck her head in something down there, and they thought she was a martyr, and she had no business to be into. Now we find that these men [Brother Branham claps his hands] had something they could clap their hands about. They were happy. They were doing something. Well, if you can do that for a principle that you think is right here; and then stand in a church and somebody clap their hands or pat their foot, the deacons would lead them out the door. See, they have turned their people to a filthy cesspool of creed and denomination, instead of feeding them on the blessed holy Word of God, that’s delivered by the Power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. See, they try to, they quench their thirst by saying, “I am Doctor So-and-so,” or come out of a certain seminary or a certain school. But that don’t mean one thing, not a thing. But, you see, they, they try to satisfy themselves, say, “Now God will recognize me because I am His pastor. God will recognize me because I am holy Father So-and-so, or Bishop So-and-so,” or something like that. They are trying to satisfy their thirst there, when you can’t do it. “I got a Ph.D., LL.D. I got my Bachelor of Art. I got this.” That’s all right. But, to me, that just means you’re that much farther away from God. That’s right. That much further away from God, all the time! You only know God by an experience. You cannot educate This into you. It’s borned into you! It’s something that God gives you. Education has nothing to do with It. One of the greatest men in the Bible couldn’t even sign his name, Saint Peter. That’s exactly right, him and John, the Bible said, “They were both ignorant and unlearned.” But it pleased Jesus to give him the keys to the Kingdom, because he was thirsting for God. Amen. Thirsting for God, fellowship. Yes, sir. Oh, my! I think of Isaiah, that young man, oh, a fine young man, he was down there in the temple, one day. The great king, and he put his face towards him and thought he was one of the greatest men. Which, he was a great man. He was raised up, fine parents, a good mother and dad. But when he went out, his politics was clean, and he made things right with God. And Isaiah looked at him and thought he was a great man, put him for an example. But don’t you (never) put no man, but the Man Christ Jesus, for your Example. All man will fail. After a while, he got to a place; he was king, but he tried to take a priest’s place and went into the temple, and he was stricken with leprosy. Then Isaiah was all worried, so he goes down to the temple and he begin to pray, he thought he would go down and pray a while. And now, look, that man was a prophet; but down there in the temple was a young man, he was crying out to God, one day, and a vision fell before him. And when he did, he seen Angels, Cherubims, with Their faces covered with Their wings, and Their feet covered, and flying with two wings. And They were going back and forth, up-and-down through the temple, crying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.” And Isaiah, that great thirst that he had had, he perhaps was schooled. He probably had a good education. He had a marvelous conception of what God ought to be. He had heard the priests. He had been in the temple. He had been raised to be a believer, but, you see, he had never come face to face with It before. See? He had a desire to do right. He wanted to be right, but he just had the educational side. He had the theological side of It. But when he got there in the temple that day, and he seen these Cherubims waving these wings back and forth, and realized that these Angels ministered in the face of God (And Them Angels didn’t even know what sin was; and to stand in the Presence of God They had to cover Their holy faces, to stand in the Presence of God.), then that prophet cried out, “Woe is me, for I am a man of unclean lips. All of my theology, theology and stuff that I’ve learned, all of my marvelous conception that I had of God, I am face to face with it now.” He said, “I’m a man of unclean lips, and I dwell with people that’s unclean lips.” All their teaching of the laws, and things they had done, had never reached that place to where he come into the Presence of God, and seen God with his own eyes; and His trail, when He was sitting up on High, in the Heavens. And there he was, face to face with reality. And he cried, “I’m a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among unclean people.” Then it was that the Cherubim took the tongs, and a coal of Fire from the altar, and touched them unclean lips. And turned him from a coward, or from an educated man, a teacher, to a prophet that the Word of God could speak through. Sure, while he was in the Presence of God, It was something different. That thirst that he had had, had reached that place then, till he was filled with It. And let me tell you, friend, I don’t care how many churches you join, how many names you put on, which a way you go, and whether you are sprinkled, baptized, or whatever you are; until you meet that Person, Jesus Christ! That, that’s the only thing that will really satisfy. Emotion won’t do it; you might jump up-and-down and shout as long as you want to, or you might run up-and-down the floor, and you might speak in tongues as much as you want to. And them things are holy and good. I don’t say nothing against that. But until you meet that Person, that satisfying Portion, that Something that takes every fiber in your body; not by emotion, but by a satisfaction! Used to see a little sign, said, “If you’re thirsty, say Parfay.” Used to be a little drink, when I was a boy, called Parfay. I remember coming down the road, oh, from fishing, I had been up to the pond, old stagnant waters. And I was about starved to death, and I seen a sign say, “If you’re thirsty, just say Parfay.” I started saying, “Parfay, Parfay.” I got thirstier all the time. And I … See, I got so I couldn’t even spit, after a while, I was so thirsty. Well, you see, that won’t do it. There is nothing will satisfy it. I don’t care, you can drink cokes, you can drink anything you want to, with them sweetened by carbonated waters, and so forth, there is nothing that will satisfy the thirst like a good cool, cold stream of water. That’ll quench that thirst. All these other things are substitutes. And why would we want to take a substitute, when there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost that satisfies every fiber and longing in the human soul? Then stand right in the face of death, like the great Apostle Paul said, “O death, where is your sting? And, grave, where is your victory? But thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!” That’s the experience, brother, that satisfies that holy hush that … or that holy thirst that’s in you. It satisfies it. You don’t have to do anything else about it. Yeah, It cleanses the lips. And there is, also, just people who live upon the emotion, upon the … Some people say, “Well, we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal movement.” And they will go in, which is fine, they’ll pat their hands [Brother Branham claps his hands.] and play the music. The music stops, “sh, whew,” a bucket of water went over everything, see. Now we do that, we got in a habit of doing that. We got, we … It’s just become one of our customs. Let me tell you something. When you’re worshiping God, in the Spirit and in Truth, when it becomes a custom for you to do it, because you think you ought to do it; because you think, if you don’t shout, or jump up-and-down, or dance with the music, your neighbor is going to think you’re backslid; you are drinking from a stagnated stream. Right! Until It fills every fiber, until the Holy Spirit Itself bubbling in you; I don’t care whether the music is playing, whether they’re playing Nearer, My God, To Thee, or whatever it is, the Holy Spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart. That satisfies. That’s God’s satisfying Portion. Anything less than That, you’re done. You might speak with tongue like men and Angels, you might give all your goods to feed the poor, you might prophesy, and you might have knowledge, understand all the mysteries and all these things, and you still become nothing (First Corinthians 13) until that satisfying Something that can only quench that thirst. “My soul thirsts for the living God, like the hart panting for the water brook. Unless I can find It, I’ll perish.” When you get to hungering for God like that, something is going to take place. The Holy Spirit is to lead you to those great fountains of God. Yes, sir. Now, there is a good thing, to worship in the Spirit. That’s true. But sometimes you have Spirit without Truth. Saint John 4, said, “We worship God, Spirit and Truth.” And Jesus is the Truth. That’s exactly right. And He is the Word. The streams God sent to satisfy you, in the natural, Satan has polluted every one of them. He has put the poisoned dope in every one that he could get into. That’s right. He took that great stream, of the church. That, that was God’s way. Jesus said, “Upon this Rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell can’t prevail against It.” Now there is different arguments of that. The Roman people, the Catholic says, “He built It upon Peter.” See, and if that be so, Peter backslid, in a few days. So, It wasn’t. It sure wasn’t built upon Peter, Petra, the little rock. And then the Protestant says, that, “He built It upon Himself, Jesus Christ.” Not to be different, but I differ with them. He never built It on either one. He built It upon the revelation of Who He was. He said, “Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you.” Not by knowledge! You didn’t learn It by books. You didn’t learn It by joining church. You didn’t learn It in the shouts. You did … But the Holy Ghost Itself has brought the Person of Jesus Christ to you, then, “Upon this Rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell can’t prevail against It.” That holy thirst has been satisfied in the Person of Jesus Christ. There you are. That’s the thing that we want to look for, satisfy that thirst with That. All right, we find that we must. Knowledge? Oh, my! Knowledge is a great thing, we fill up, and today we’re full of it. But you see, knowledge … as I was saying the other day, speaking on that subject of knowledge. There was a man standing outside, was talking to a friend of mine standing there, said, “If a man don’t believe in education, why is he reading the Bible?” They … I thought, “Well, if they didn’t get what the Lord Jesus said, how are they going to get a dummy like me, what I say?” They couldn’t even understand Him, as plain as He was. He said there one day, “Except you eat the body, the Blood, drink the Blood and eat the body of the Son of man, you have no Life in you.” He didn’t explain It. He walked on. That’s right. See? “Well,” they said, “this Man is a cannibal. We want Him … to eat His body, drink His Blood. He is a vampire. See, He wants us to become a vampire.” See? Them intellectuals! But He said, “My sheep hear My Voice.” See, It would come to the Elected, God had elected by foreknowledge. “And those who the Father … No man can come to Me except the Father draws him. And all the Father has given Me, they will come, they’ll understand It.” Them disciples couldn’t understand It, but they believed It. See? That’s right. If you believe It! I can’t understand many things. I believe It, anyhow, see, because God said It was so. Knowledge. You know, Satan’s gospel is knowledge. Did you know that? He preached it in the garden of Eden, to Eve, and she was deceived by his knowledge gospel. Now, and has polluted the whole human race, with it. That’s exactly right. They’ve took educational programs, put them in the church. They’re all right out there, but not in God’s Word. No, sir. You don’t know God by education. You don’t know God by knowing how, learning mathematics and pronouncing big words. Paul, he was a smart man. But when he come to Christ, and received the Holy Spirit, went to the Corinthians, he said, “I never come to you with enticing words of man’s wisdom,” though he could have done it. Said, “I come to you in power and manifestations of the Holy Ghost, that your faith would be in God, not in the wisdom of some man.” Now sometimes we make the church programs, they also call for their pastor. The church goes to vote the pastor, they say, “Well, this pastor, now, he has got two degrees in college. He learned four years of psychology. He took this, that, the other.” And they’ll vote that kind of a man in (why?) instead of a pastor who believes in God’s Word being inspired and being God, and will preach the Word regardless of how people feel about It. God told Ezekiel, you know, said, “Preach that whether they believe It or not. You preach It, anyhow.” See? Right. Whether they accept It, or not, that ain’t it. They didn’t accept Jesus. He went right on, preaching It just the same. See? Instead of a real pastor that will really preach the Word and believe in God, they try to bring in the intellect, the man who has got the best education; the man who can stand in the pulpit and don’t take but just about fifteen minutes, so they can get home right quick, and go (some) do something else, and Ricky can get his hot rod and start out, and they can go to the twist parties and everything. And it’s, oh, it’s just it’s nothing else but a hybrid educational pollution. That’s right. Just exactly what it is. That’s right. But what is it? It satisfies their taste, see, it satisfies a worldly church member’s taste. It don’t satisfy a saint’s taste. He’ll take the Word every time! But they say, “Oh, well, now them people is just a little off at their mind.” See, they just don’t, they don’t get it. They, they’re trying to live in a day gone by. Isn’t it strange! I come out here in the West, and I find out they’re all trying to live in a day gone by, they always want some of the old-fashion cowboy days. And go down in Kentucky, the old-fashion hillbilly days, they want to act like it, have programs of it. But when it comes to old-fashion Religion, they don’t want nothing about It. Old-fashion days? I come down here in the rodeo time, I seen they had a big woman down there, that green stuff under her eyes, and short bobbed hair, a cigarette in her mouth. Why, if they’d have seen that back in the old days, they’d have thought she was cankered somewhere. They, they’d have put her in. What if your mother would have walked out, dressed like you and your daughter dress today, what would taken place? They’d had her in the insane institution. Sure, she come out without her skirt on. Well, now remember, it’s the same thing today. Man is rottening in their flesh. If they’re going through the middle age, between twenty and twenty-five years old, their brain cells are rottening too. They haven’t got … People has got so they haven’t got enough understanding. They don’t know what decency means. They don’t know the difference between right and wrong. And, oh, though, their educational program, they … Did you know, education, I can prove it to you, is of the devil? Not to read and write; but, I mean, putting their education in your church. What does communism lay on? Science, education, that’s their god. Satan, see, that’s what he introduced to Eve. That’s what they’re still holding to. Now it’s got over in our churches, got over in the Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterian, Pentecostals, and all. Some education, intellectual, some great so-and-so and something like that, that just throws him farther away from God. It’s wrong. Yes, sir. Now, we find out, that (they) it satisfies their desire. When a church would vote-in something like that, it goes to show what’s in that church’s mind, what their desire is, what their thirsting is for. They want to say, “Our pastor is wide minded. He don’t mind us mix-bathing, and he goes with us.” A little girl told my Sarah, the other day. Her pastor had been to Africa; and when he come back, she stripped off her clothes, that night, with a pair of little tights on, and done the watusi for him, to entertain him because he had been to Africa. The Watusi is a tribe over there, you know. Boy, I’d like to see one of my girls, in my congregation, try to do something like that, watusi? See, it goes to show! And a pastor would sit and look at one of his congregation, a little (sixteen or eighteen years old) girl out there stripped off like that, and let her get by with that, that shows that he come out of a cesspool, himself, a man of God do a thing like that. Certainly. That sounds flat, but I realize I’m preaching across the nation, too. But you know this also, brother, sister, let me tell you, that’s the Truth. A vulture wants dead things. That’s right. And that’s dead! That’s exactly right. Plainly shows, it just plainly show here what is their head and their control tower, what it’s giving them, see, what’s in their soul. Their soul longeth for things like that. Their soul longeth for a high intellectual church, where the people dress real fine, and the pastor takes fifteen minutes, or twenty. And if you go over that, they drawed him back on the deacon board. And he mustn’t say nothing about sin. He mustn’t say anything about wearing shorts, and wouldn’t say nothing about people doing this, that, or the other. He mustn’t mention that at all. If they do, the board will have him throwed out. See what it is? That’s their thinking man’s filter. The Bible said, in First John 2:15, “If you love this world system, or the things of this world, it’s because that the love of God is not even in you.” Now what about all this carrying on they done today, in the name of the church; practicing square dancing in the church, bunco, bingo, parties, teenagers rock-and-roll, twists, all these stuff! Look at this Elvis Presley, a devil standing in shoes! Pat Boone, Ricky Nelson, the biggest indebtedment this nation has ever had! That’s right. They say, “Oh, they are very religious, they sang Christian songs.” They oughtn’t. The church oughtn’t to even permit a thing like that! Some of these guys go out here, and tonight they’re in a roadhouse out here, dancing and playing music and everything, and the next night they come to the altar and weep, and the next night they’re playing music on the platform. Oh, goodness, gracious! How far can filth, how far could filth go, anyhow? Yes, sir. Prove himself first to be a man of God, not all this stuff just because he can beat an old guitar or something. By your desire, you can tell who is on the throne of your heart. By what you love, that’s what tells. You, you say, “Well, I think them things are all right, Brother Branham.” Well, just remember now, in your heart, you know what’s there. Yes, sir. By what is feeding your soul, what your soul is thirsting for, and you can see it satisfies that; if it isn’t this Word, then there is something wrong, because the Holy Spirit lives on the Word only. See? I want you to see another great danger, just before we close, if you’re not guilty of any of these things that I’ve mentioned, and, that is, the danger of neglecting a thirst. See? You say, “I have a holy thirst. But I’m not guilty, Brother Branham, of just go and joining church, and things like this.” But, see, to neglect a thirst! If you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food, you will die. And if you neglect that thirst in you, for God, you will spiritually die. You call for revivals, you wait for your church to have a revival. Well, that ain’t the revival for you. The revival ought to begin right in you, when you begin to thirst for God. There might not be another member, of the church, wanting that revival. If it breaks out in you, it will break out other places. See? But, see, you neglect that thirst. You neglect to milk the cow, when the cow is … the udder is full of milk; and if you let that cow stay like that, she’ll go dry. That’s exactly right. If you neglect to take a drink of water, say, “I just ain’t going to drink anymore,” you’ll die. You neglect to eat food, you’ll die. So if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the Word of God, you’ll die. You Christians, you Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Pentecostals, Assemblies of God, Oneness, Twoness, Threeness, whatever you are, see; don’t care, that don’t matter nothing to me, I don’t think it does to God. See, you’re an individual, you’re a unit. You’ll never go to Heaven as a church, or a denomination. You’ll go to Heaven as one single person, between you and God. That’s all. Don’t care what church you belong to. And if you neglect to read the Bible and to believe the Bible, and the Holy Spirit to feed upon That, you will die. Jesus said in Saint John 4:3; the Scripture I got right … Jesus said that, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word,” not just part of It. We take a little, bit here. I call that a Bible hitchhiker. They say, “Well, I believe This, but now let’s go over here, see.” See? You’ve got to take It, Word by Word. Jesus said, “Man shall live by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Did you know that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] And, you know, we’ve made the day that we’re living in, we made this day the … a religious perversion. My daughter called me in, not long ago, and said to me, “Daddy,” in the next side of the house, she said, “come over here, we’re going to have a religious program on.” It was a singing, hymn singing, and there was some little Ricky reading it up there. And if I ever seen a sacrilegious movement, it was that! Them guys up there, and people, looked more like it was a floorshow. Supposed to be an Indian tribe, and they were carrying on, and jump up and box at one another. Where, what’s went with the sincerity, where is those old-fashion hymns we used to sing, and rejoice in the Spirit of God, and tears roll down our cheeks? And now we try to hold our breath until we ain’t got enough breath in us, till our face turns blue, to try to show that we are some sort of a singer. See, we’ve copied that off of Hollywood, and all these programs that we see through this intellectual hymn sing and training of voice. I like to hear good singing; I like to hear good old-fashion, heartfelt, pentecostal singing. But I sure hate to hear that squeaking they call singing, today. That’s right. I think that’s the most ridiculous thing. It’s a perversion. That’s right. I like to see a man when he’s a man. I hate to see one with his wife’s underclothes on out here, and slipped up along the side; and a roller hanging down here in front, and two tones of hair hanging down like bangs, cut in front. That, I couldn’t call that a man. He don’t know what side of the race he belongs on. See? That’s right. You see the woman, look, the woman is trying to cut her, make her hair like the man; the man is trying to make his hair, bangs, like the woman. The man is wearing his wife’s underneath clothes; she is wearing his overalls. See, just a perversion, right around. And that’s the same thing it is with nation, with people, with churches, with everything. O God! Where is the end of the thing? The Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, that’s the end of it. So, if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit the Word of God! Jesus said, “Every Word shall be by the Holy Spirit.” And listen now. If you try to feed It the wrong thing, if It’s the genuine Holy Spirit in you, It’ll know the difference. Now, remember, the Word of God is what the Holy Spirit feeds on. It don’t feed on enthusiasm. It don’t feed on education. It doesn’t feed on churchgoing. It doesn’t feed on theologies. There is a lot of difference between an inspired something and a theological standpoint of it. All those theologians in the days of Jesus, my, they had word by word, page by page, all laid out, the Messiah had to come this way! That’s exactly what it was. And they, every one, missed it. You know what Jesus said when He come, said, “You are of your father the devil, and his works you’ll do.” It wasn’t revealed to them what the real Word was. See, they’ve missed those little corners, like they’re missing today. “If you’ll belong to this and belong to this, you’ll be all right.” Don’t you believe that. You’ve got to belong to Christ. And if there is Something in you, hungering for Christ! Just remember, when you were in your father’s loins, you were with him then. But your father didn’t know you then, and you didn’t know your father. And you had to come and be born. God made a way through your mother, for the seedbed, and then it come. And then you become a man or a woman, whatever it was, then you recognized your father, and your father could have fellowship with you. Now, remember, if you’ve got Eternal Life, your Life was in God at the beginning. And, the Life, God is the Word. And then when the Word was made flesh in Jesus Christ, God coming down to dwell in His Own body, made Himself the Son of God. When God came down to dwell in that, you were in Him when He was crucified. And you were crucified with Him, and you died with Him on Calvary. You was buried with Him, on the mountain. And you rose with Him, on Easter morning. And now you’re setting together in Heavenly places, in Him, and now you’ve got fellowship with Him. See? God Himself become one of us. “No man has seen the Father, at any time, the only Begotten of the (Son) Father has declared Him.” That’s, God became a Man, so He could fellowship you as a man. See? And now you are flesh, and He is flesh. God is made flesh among us, in the Person of His Son, Jesus Christ. And in Him was God. He was God, nothing short of God. He was God. “God manifested in the Son, Jesus Christ,” which made Him Emmanuel, as the prophet said He would be. Now see, then, you had to be before the world was ever formed, your name was put on the Lamb’s Book of Life. And then what can you eat? The Holy Spirit lives by the Word of God. And now in Revelation 22:19, the Bible said, “Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.” See how deep it is? You cannot, the Holy Spirit won’t live on the things of the world. Like a dove bird and a crow. A crow is a big hypocrite. A crow, that fellow can go out here and can eat wheat all day long; and go over there and fly on dead, the old dead carcass, and eat it too. He can sit in the field and he can eat with the dove, wheat, and go over and eat on the dead carcass. But the dove can eat wheat all day long, but it can’t eat on a dead carcass, because it’s a dove. And a dove don’t have any gall. One bite out of that dead carcass, it’d kill the dove. See, it has no gall. And that’s the way it is, no bitterness. That’s the way with a real, genuine Christian. They don’t want the things of the world. They just eat the Word of God, and That alone; what’s clean, the thinking man’s Filter. See, they come through That, and That alone. The dead things of the world, it stinks to them. Look at the old crow in the days of the antediluvian destruction, flying from body to body, eating them old dead carcasses, he didn’t come back to the ark. But the dove could find no rest for her feet, see, she come back to the ark where she was getting grain. And that’s the way we do, we live by the Word of God. In Psalms 42. David must have wrote this Psalm, Psalms 42, when he was a fugitive, when he said, “My soul thirsts after Thee, as a hart panteth after the water brook.” Look, he cried. David was a fugitive. He had been … He had the anointing oil on him, he knowed he was going to be king. The prophet had anointed him king. Now notice, and there he was, he had a little bunch of soldiers, made up of Gentiles, and so forth, was up on top of the mountain. Where, his own beloved city, because of their sin, they were garrisoned all around with the Philistines. And David, on that hot day, it must have been when he wrote this Psalm, “As the hart panteth for the water brook.” Notice David in this condition. He looked down, he looked at his beloved city. And he remembered when he was a little boy, he used to take the sheep out by this certain pool there. It was a great, great water country, and also bread country, down there. Really, Bethlehem, means “the house of God’s Bread.” And then when David remembered going by there and drinking that good cool water, and here he was laying up here now, a fugitive, away from his own people. He had no place to go, and his soul must have cried for that good cool water. He had some servants there that, my, just the least of his desire was a command. And they, three of them, fought their way through that line of Philistines; fifteen miles, seven miles, or something, down and back; cutting their way through, and brought him a drink of that water. But the soul thirst … His body, he was up there, probably had to drink out of anything he could get a hold of, some old goat skins and things, with some old hot water in, on that hot day. He thought, “If I could just lay down and quench this thirst that I have! If I could just go down there to Bethlehem and lay down by that spring, and drink!” And when they went down and got the water, and brought it back, his soul thirst was so greater, not for Bethlehem, but from Jerusalem; his soul was. So he sacrificed the water, said, “I wouldn’t even drink it.” He poured it out upon the ground. See, his soul was more thirsty for God, than it was to satisfy the quench of a good … his thirst of his body, with a good cool water. He poured it upon the ground. See, the House of God, the soul-cooling waters of Jerusalem, which is above! Jesus said, in John 6:33, “I am the, Bread of Life. I am the Bread of Life.” Bethlehem, “house of God,” our church, earthly church of God, the church that’s here on earth. We love to go to the church here on earth, but greater is Jerusalem, which is above, which is God. Jerusalem above, which is God! Greater is that soul’s thirst, to be there with Him, than it would to be just to satisfy yourself with joining a church somewhere. See, joining a church don’t satisfy that thirst. David proved it here, the waters right from the house of God, see, he poured it out upon the ground; to find favor, to get a good cool drink from God. Even on that … Greater than the thirst that’s in you, is that thirst of the soul-thirst for God. Notice Jerusalem, the word. “Jerusalem is from above,” the Bible said, “which we’re … is the Mother of us all.” And Christ is our Mother. We realize that God is our Mother, for we are born of Him. The word simply means “peace,” Jerusalem, Shalom. Or, Shalom, which means “peace,” Jeru-shalom, see, means “peace.” Greater should be the thirst of any soul, for the waters of Life, than to say you belong to a church; the thirst of the soul can’t be satisfied, the real true thirst. It can be perverted. You can think you are all right when you join church, but that isn’t It. That won’t satisfy the genuine holy thirst for God. It just simply won’t do it. It just … It’s just not there. Now David said, in Psalms 42:7 here, “When the deep calleth unto the Deep, at the noise of Thy waterspout,” the soul’s call. Look, I’ve often used this as an illustration. If there is a fin on a fish’s back, it had to be put there for him to swim with. He has a need for that. Now what if he’d say, “I’m going to be a different fish. I’m going to be a smart, educated fish. Uh-huh, I’ll just … I’m going to believe some real theology! I believe I don’t have to have that fin”? He wouldn’t get very far in the water, would he? And that’s exactly right. What if a tree said, “Now, I know there had to be an earth first, for me to grow in. That’s right. I’m supposed to grow in the earth. But I’m going to be a different tree, I want them just set me out here in the middle of the street, so I can be noticed”? See, he wouldn’t live very long. See? That’s right. “When the deep calleth to the Deep”: It takes more than joining a church. It takes more than shaking hands with the preacher. It takes more than living a good, straight life. It takes something to satisfy inside of you, that pours down from God, into the soul. “The deep calling to the Deep, at the noise of Thy waterspouts, O Lord. The deep calling to the Deep!” What kind of a thirst could we think was in us tonight? We, as Pentecostal people, where are we getting to? What kind of a thirst is in us? What kind of a thirst is in me? What kind of thirst is in you? Don’t try to hush that holy thirst for God. Years ago, when they used to have gold out here in the mountains. I read a story, many years ago, it’s always stuck with me. It said there was a prospector went out here somewhere beyond the mountains here, and was prospecting for gold, and he struck a rich claim. And he come back, thinking; when he got to the city, what he would be, his troubles was all over. And he tried to say, “Tomorrow I’ll get in and I’ll … ” Just one day’s journey, he would be into the city, and he would have the gold. And he had big sacks full of it. He had a dog with him. Not comparing now the dog to the Holy Spirit, but as I’m making an illustration. But this dog … Through the night, the prospector laid upon his bed, and he begin to think, “Now, tomorrow I’ll take all my gold in, and I’ll become just what I’ve always wanted to be. I always wanted to be a rich man. I wanted to own fine things, and so forth.” And then this dog begin to bark, and because there was an enemy approaching. And he went out there, and he said, “Shut up!” And so the dog quietened down. And no more than got back in bed, he started like he was going to go to sleep, and the dog started again, just jumping at the chain. And he went to the door again, said, “Shut up! I want you to know that tomorrow I’m a rich man, see,” and that was his great dreams. But the dog started barking again. And finally, he got so discouraged, he went and got his shotgun and shot the dog, and killed it. He said, “I won’t have no more use for you, anyhow. Tomorrow I’m a rich man. I will become a rich man, tomorrow.” And he sit the gun down in the corner, turned his back over to the door, went to sleep. And the man had been following him, for days, slipped in and killed him. He wasn’t a rich man, see, he stopped that warning buzzer that was trying to tell him his life was at stake. And, brother, sister, you will never be able to … Don’t never try to hush that holy calling in your heart, see, by joining a church, by reciting a creed, by belonging to a certain organization. There is only one thing can satisfy it, that’s the Person, Jesus Christ. “As the hart panteth for the water brook, so my soul thirsts after Thee, O God. My soul thirsts for the living God!” See, there is something in you, that wants to see the moving of God. Your soul thirsts for It. Don’t stop anything short of That. Don’t let some pastor tell you, “You just have to shake his hand, join the church, or belong to this organization.” Don’t you kill that holy hush. It’s warning you. Some day will come when you’ll come down to the end of the road. Like a little lady in our city we come from. She told the … A little girl went up there to church, and a very fine little girl. And she was coming down the street. She had long hair, you know, and her hair pulled back like a slick of the peeled onion, nearly, and her face looked … no make-up on. And this girl used to make fun of her, said, “If you didn’t have that flat-headed preacher you got up there,” speaking of me, said, “you could look like something decent. But you look like something out of an antique shop.” And, oh, she just really raked her over the coals, every time she could see her like that. Said, “Our pastor is broad-minded.” Said, “He knows them. That, why you do like that? That don’t mean anything, how you dress or think.” It does! God’s Bible says it does. We shall live by every Word! So this little girl never paid a bit of attention to her, went on. She is a missionary now. So then this young lady took a social disease, and she died. A friend of mine pumped the embalming fluid in her when she was dying. He told me, said … After she was dead, he kept smelling the fluid. She had a hole eat in her side, social disease. They didn’t even … Even her parents didn’t know what was wrong with her. And she died. But before she died … She taught Sunday school. And all of her little Sunday school group come in, they wanted to see her when she went off to Heaven, the Angels come and pack her away. And her pastor outside, smoking a cigarette, walking up-and-down the hall in the hospital. And they was all going to sing when she was going to die, you know. They knowed she had to die. Doctors said she was dying, so they was all going to see the Angels come, pack her away. And all at once, when she faced the reality! Now, she was a loyal church member, she was a Sunday school teacher, and a loyal church member of a fine big denominational church. But when she started to struggle, death struck her; her eyes bulged out, and she said, “I’m lost!” She said, “I’m lost! Go, get the pastor!” He put his cigarette out, and walked in, said, “Here, here! Here, here! We’ll get the doctor to give you a hypo.” Said, “I don’t want no hypo.” Said, “You deceiver of man! I’m dying, and I’m going to hell. And I’m lost because you failed to tell me the Truth. Go get that little Goodhue’s girl, and bring her up here to me, real quick. She is right.” Wait till you face the reality once. Don’t you try to stop that holy hush. Don’t you blast It away with some modern, educational, double-barreled shotgun. You listen to that warning of the Holy Ghost, tonight, that’s warning you, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.” And He is the Word. Let us bow our heads just a moment. I want to quote one more Word of the Lord Jesus, while you’re thinking about it. Jesus said, in Matthew 5, “Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst.” It’s even blessed to have that thirst in you. Have you come to a spot that your whole system has been so polluted by denominationalisms, and little cults and clans, and things, little church orders, social, like joining lodges, and so forth, from church to church? Has the devil been able to put that water of pollution, and you’re slopping out of it, like a hog in a trough? When, you don’t even know what the real quenching thirst of God; to see Him, a reality, by the Holy Spirit living in you, and manifesting. If you’re that way tonight, if you’re still thirsting for God, let me tell you: There is a Fountain filled with Blood, Drawn from Immanuel’s veins, Where sinners plunged beneath the flood, Lose all their guilty stain. That dying thief rejoiced to see That Fountain in his day; There may I, though vile as he, Wash all my sins away. Ever since by faith I saw that stream Thy flowing wounds supply, Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die. If you’ve got that thirst tonight, to know more about God, and to come closer to Him, will you just raise up your hand now? While every head is bowed, say, “Pray for me.” O God, look at the hands! Out into the land where the broadcast is coming now, from East, North, West, and South, you in them rooms, raise up your hands to the pastors and whatever is there, that you desire; you, something in you, thirsting for God. That holy thirst! Don’t satisfy it … Oh, you say, “Brother Branham, I shouted once. I danced in the Spirit.” Don’t, don’t, don’t take that. No. Wait till that satisfaction comes, the satisfaction Portion of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in, then these joy bells of shouting, and speaking in tongues, and dancing in the Spirit, will come. You won’t have to do it by the music. You will do it when you’re going down the road, in your car. You will do it when you’re sweeping the floor. You will do it when you’re driving nails in the wall, with your carpenter work. Wherever you are, that Joy unspeakable and full of glory! Now let us pray. Dear Heavenly Father! Long, lengthy, drawed out, this little Message tonight, but, Dear God, may Your Holy Spirit deliver the meaning to every heart. Right in this church, tonight, there was just multiplied numbers of hands up, all the way around the halls and everywhere. We pray, dear God, for them. Oh, may that satisfying Portion of God (which is Christ, the Hope of Glory, the Hope of Life, in you), may It come to each one of them. Way out across the nation, from California, way up in New York now, where it’s early in the morning, they’re listening in up there; over in New Hampshire, and down along in Boston, and all the way down in Texas, through Indiana, out into California, and around. O God, look at those hands; look what’s beneath them, Lord, that heart there that’s hungering and thirsting. This perverted day, where the devil has blinded people’s eyes, just to join church, and say, “That’s all you need.” And they still look at their own self and see the way they do, and the desire they have to be like the world. When, the Bible tells us, “If we even love the things of the world, the love of God is not even in us.” Just think, Father, how perverted that he can make that real true Word, how that they can say, “Oh, we believe the Bible, but not This. We don’t believe This. We believe This was for another age. We believe this is That,” because, some denomination has twisted their minds into that cesspool. When, Jesus said, “Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.” Dear God! Think of the disappointments there at Judgment, when people has lived a good, clean, holy life, went to church just as loyal as they could be, and lost. Think of those Pharisees, how, from little boys, they trained in the Word, come up through schools and everything, holy (had to be, or they’d be stoned to death), and Jesus said, “You are of your father the devil.” How that Israel went down there! And let this be a warning to the Pentecostals, Lord, across the land. How that Moses, a prophet, came down into Egypt, to fulfill the Word of God, to bring the evening light to them! How they seen the great miracles of God! How they followed him, crossed the Red Sea, was baptized unto him, went into the wilderness and eat Angels’ food that fell from Heaven. And then refused to take all the Word, when they come back from Kadesh-barnea … to Kadesh-barnea, from the promised land, and said, “they’re like giants; we can’t do it.” When, God said, “I’ve already give you the land”! Border line! Jesus said, “They are, every one, perished. They are dead,” lost, without God, though they done all these things. They seen these miracles; enjoyed, danced up-and-down the seacoast, with Miriam, when they beat the tambourine. And only three, out of the two million, went in. We realize, Father, that when the sperm, the genes from the male and female, come together, there is only one, out of a million, that’s accepted. One germ from the male finds the fertile egg of the woman, the female, and a million others perish. There is a million, two million, come out of Egypt; two, Joshua and Caleb, entered the land. One out of a million. Father, I tremble when I think of that. Think, across the world today, five hundred million Christians, that would be five hundred if You should come tonight. O God, let us remember that every Word of God stands, a memorial. We must believe It. We must obey It. And when You said, “Repent, every one of you, and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to them that’s far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.” And, God, You are still calling, tonight, and the promise is as long as You call. And clergymen has twisted the minds of those people, and directed it by an educational, denominational school of theology, to a thing to say, “Oh, you just believe.” The devil believes also, but he can’t receive the Holy Spirit. Judas Iscariot was a … done all the rest, the disciples did, preach the Gospel; but when it come time for him to get the Holy Ghost, he showed his colors. God, may the people of the land tonight realize that, without that experience, they are lost. May it be tonight that their souls will be satisfied with Thy Portion, Lord, as we commend them into Thy hand. They are Yours, Lord. We’re only responsible for the Word. I pray that they will believe with all their heart, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. We ask in Jesus’ Name. Amen. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. Oh, is He your satisfying Portion? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Oh, my! You love Him with all your heart? [“Amen.”] Now, them Words are sometimes cutting, but let’s just sing in the Spirit now, see, each one of us now. Let’s shake hands with the brother setting next to you, sister, and just say, “God bless you, pilgrim,” as we sing it again. [Brother Branham shakes hands with the people.] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. Now we shook hands with each other. Now let’s just close our eyes and sing in the Spirit, raise our hands to Him. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. Oh, isn’t He wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, The Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Oh, saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name! Oh, wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name! Oh, are you enthused about your experience with Christ? [Congregation rejoices, “Amen.”] Isn’t He wonderful? Doesn’t He satisfy? I once was lost, now I’m found, free from condemnation, Jesus gives liberty and a full salvation; Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name. Oh, wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Oh, saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name! Do you believe that’s Scriptural? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] The Bible said, “Clap your hands. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.” You know, I always wanted to play music. My daughter, Rebekah, is taking piano. My little boy is taking trumpet. But I did learn an instrument of ten-strings. [Brother Branham begins clapping his hands.] Wonderful, wonderful, Jesus is to me, Counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God is He; Saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame, Wonderful is my Redeemer, praise His Name! Do you love Him? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] We’ll walk in the Light, a beautiful Light, Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. We’ll walk in the Light, it’s such a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. [Brother Branham begins to hum, “Jesus, the Light of the World,” and then the congregation also hums with him.] Worship God with everything you have. When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Oh, when they crown Him Lord of all, When they crown Him Lord of all, Lord, I want to be in that number When they crown Him Lord of all. Oh, when the sun refuse to shine, When the sun refuse to shine, Lord, I want to be in that number When the sun refuse to shine. Do you love that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Now I wonder if you got your feet converted, you don’t dance anymore, out there for the world? See? Let’s pat our feet, to the Lord, to the Lord. You, is your hands converted, you don’t steal anymore? Your lips are converted, you don’t lie anymore? Just don’t get religion in your head, get it all over you. That’s it. It takes the whole man. That’s right. Now let’s pat our feet. When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Oh, when the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. Now let’s just raise our hands. When the saints go marching in, When the saints go marching in, O Lord, I want to be in that number When the saints go marching in. When they crown Him Lord of all, When they crown Him Lord of all, Lord, I want to be in that number When they crown Him Lord of all. Don’t you love Him? [Congregation rejoices, “Amen! Glory! Hallelujah!”] Then we’ll walk in the Light (He is the Light, you know), It’s a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Well, shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Do you believe He is the Light of the world? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Do you? Paul said, “When I sing, I’ll sing in the Spirit. If I worship, I’ll worship in the Spirit.” See, whatever you do, do it all in the Spirit. That’s right. And the Spirit brings the Word to Life. Is that right? That’s right. Yes, sir. All ye saints of Light proclaim, Jesus, the Light of the world; Grace and mercy in His Name, Jesus, the Light of … Then what do we do? We’ll walk in the Light, beautiful Light, Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Sorry to confuse you players, like that, but I just get carried away. I don’t know no better than just to worship. That’s the way you do it. Yes, sir. I’m thankful for this opportunity, Brother Mack, to come and fellowship with you and your church here tonight, all these fine people. And you that raised your hands for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, I trust that you’ll meet Pastor Mack here, or some of them, and go back in a room here. And just remember, when God spoke the Word in the beginning, and said “let there be,” there had to be! And He said, “Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.” See, it’s got to happen. Come to visit your pastor here, and stand by him as he preaches the Gospel. Now let’s sing again that good old song, I just love that, “We’ll walk in the Light.” Jesus said, “I am the Light,” and you are in Him. See? How do you get into Him? Joining Him? No. Shaking? No. Baptism of water? No. “By one Spirit we are all baptized into one Body, which is the Body of Christ.” And in that Body is nine spiritual gifts operating through the local body, the local church. That’s apostolic, if I ever knew of it. That’s right. So we’ll keep in the Light, in the beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops of mercy are … [Brother Branham speaks to Pastor Mack.] All right! …?… Shine all around us by day and by … [Brother Branham speaks to Pastor Mack.] Been a real pleasure! [Brother Mack says, “Thank you, brother. Thank you.”] 
[A group of children sing The Old-Time Religion.] You sure have. If it’s good enough for you all, it’s good enough for us, too. [A brother says, “Now they give their present for you.”] My, that’s cute. [The children give Brother Branham a gift.] Thank you. [A sister says, “Just a little gift, Brother Branham, the children saved their pennies and nickels. And …?… ”] Thank you. Thank you, my little brother. Thank you, children. I sure thank you, very, very much. And God bless you. You know, Jesus said, “Insomuch as you give unto the least of these, you have done it to Me.” See? You’re the men and women of tomorrow. If there is a tomorrow, you will be there. Got the penny. Thank you very much honey. Should I open it? [Brother Branham opens the gift and reads the card.] You got it so pretty, it’s kind of hard to … oh my, it’s cute. Grandfather has to get his glasses, you know: “Faith in … a grain of mustard seed … Message of you … ” Isn’t that sweet? See? Oh, my, my! I hate for you to give me this. “Dear Brother Branham, Oh, you are such a good friend. We are hoping you’ll be blessed with all the things you found. We love you; in all that happiness; and might, dear Lord Jesus richly bless you.” Oh, that’s really cute. Thank you, sweetheart, each and every one of you. That’s really nice. [A brother says, “Brother Branham, I believe you’ll agree we got a good Sunday School teacher.”] You sure have. (Just hold this for me, Billy.) Now, this is so, done up so nice, I hate to undo it. Very pretty. I bet one of the mommies did this one. Is that right? [Brother Branham opens another gift.] Huh? Well, I have to … It won’t jump out? Oh, my. Oh. Oh, my. That’s really sweet …?… we’ll go with that. Leo, going to wonder which family he belongs to. He push it in every picture. That’s really nice. Now, children, that’s the horn of plenty and I’ll take this and hang it in our new home. And I suppose as long as we have a home we’ll have this in memory of this little Sunday school here at Prescott. I give thanks to God, give thanks unto the Lord for everything; and I give thanks unto God for such fine little boys and girls as you all are. Just to think of me in this time. God bless all of you. Thanks a lot, yeah, it’s really nice. Inspiration, that’s just what we was wanting, something like that. Wasn’t we? [A brother speaks.] Fine. [A brother says the singing was planned at the last minute.] That’s when it’s better. [A group of sisters sing Down From His Glory, then the audience joins in.] O how I love Him! How I adore Him! My breath, my sunshine, my all in all! The great Creator became my Saviour, And all God’s fullness dwelleth in Him. [The sisters continue singing the chorus of Down From His Glory. A brother leads in Only Believe.]  … only believe, All things are possible, only believe; Only believe, only believe, All things are possible, only believe. I believe I could preach four hours now, after all that. I was beginning to think I was getting tired. No wonder you little girls can sing so well, you little girls and little boys; listen how your big sisters sing, and your mothers, wonderful singers. That’s really pretty. Who is this little girl that led that song, aren’t you the little girl I met across there? Sure have a beautiful voice; all of you. You just … I believe it was, best singing I have ever heard, is right here. You all practice that all the time? [A brother says, “No. That’s how we sing.”] Well, I tell you, you certainly are blessed with some real good singing. I like good singing. I just love real good singing. I’ve always said, when I get to Heaven I want to get where they’re singing, and listen. I never could get my fill of singing. You know, singing gives courage. You know that, don’t you? The soldiers, when they’re going to battle, you know what they do? They play music and sing, and things to give them courage. And when we’re going to battle, we sing, and it gives us courage to go on. I thank you little fellows for that nice gift. And it’s … Mrs. Branham, and from Rebekah, and Joseph, and Sarah, and all of us, we thank you very much. It’s hard to say, how to tell them little fellows, “No. You saved your pennies. I don’t want to take it.” You know how I feel, I don’t want to take it. But yet I looked in here and they had a ten-dollar bill in this card. I thought, “Can I take that?” I thought, “How can I do it?” But I remember a little story I want you to know. One day there was a widow woman, she had a bunch of children, perhaps her … them little children’s papa was gone. And she only had two pennies. And she come down the street, one time … And it was tithing money, just pennies like you all saved, and she threw it into the treasury of God. Jesus was standing there, watching her. And I have wondered, “What would I have done if I had been standing there?” I would probably run up and said, “No, no, sister, don’t do that. We don’t, really don’t need it. You need it for them children.” See? Now, I wouldn’t have let her done it. But Jesus let her do it. See, He let her do it. Why? He knows it’s more blessed to give than it is to receive. He knowed what He would do for her, see. So I thank you little fellows, with all my heart. I want to thank each and every one of you, for this fine time of fellowship, Brother Leo and Gene. This has actually been three days of worship, for me. Even out in the jungle, when I try to let myself go and think I was hunting, I somehow or another, I look at you and hear you talk. I had the privilege this afternoon to visit your homes. I never seen, walked into any, I’m going to call it a village, that I ever seen so many clean, neat homes and people, and so much respect for Christ and the Gospel. I never seen it anywhere. And you’re certainly started on the right road, just keep going and God will be with you. And I got to see some of you. I seen, the other day, these sisters, I didn’t even know them, ’cause all I could see would just be about their eyes and nose, out from under one of those hoods. And now I believe I know you better, through the courtesy of Brother Leo and Gene, who taken me around and visit your homes; and get to shake hands with the little children, the prophets and prophetesses of the age to come, if there is an age to come. You know, Jesus loves little children. You know, He does. And there was a little boy, one time, named Moses, we’re going to talk about him in just in a little bit. And he was a very fine … You know what made him, helped make him a fine boy? He had a good mother to raise him. See, that’s what. She taught him about the Lord. And you little boys and girls has got the same kind of mothers to raise you, teach you about the Lord. Just mind them. You know what, you know what the first Commandment is in the Bible, the first Commandment with promise, with a promise? May be a little hard for you to understand these Commandments. The first Commandment, is, “Not to have any other god but Him.” But the great Commandment … And the first Commandment that has a promise to it, see, is to the children. Did you know that? See, He said, “Children, obey your parents, which may lengthen the days upon the earth, that the Lord thy God has given thee.” To mind your parents and do what you’re doing, it may give you longer life upon the earth, that the Lord has given you, more time to serve Him. I hope, today, that I’m looking at a bunch of preachers and singers and evangelists of the day that is to come, if there is a day after ours. And there is only one thing up here, you kill a fellow with kindness. I eat till I couldn’t eat, and I never was treated so much. If I had been an Angel, dropped out of Heaven, I couldn’t have been treated any nicer. The only thing I can say to you, is, “Thank you.” And when you’re down Tucson way, I might not be able to treat you that nice, ’cause I don’t know how; I haven’t got the manners to do it, but I’ll do the best I can. Come down. Brother and Sister Shantz, I want to certainly thank them. And I had the privilege of meeting your pretty, young daughter, and son, this afternoon. And for letting us have his home here open for worship. There was such things taking place in the Bible day, you know, that the Gospel was … I know it sounds very little. We, we would think it isn’t. But this is just the same as God … to God, as them was in that day. Remember, if there would be another many years, they would look back here and say, “If I’d have only lived in the days up there at Prescott! If I’d have only lived … ” See? Now we are living in that day. See? Then we come down to the end of the road, then we wait for our reward at the big Day. Now we’re going to open the Word of God and read. But just before we do, let us speak to Him just a moment. Dear Jesus, I cannot express my feelings and my gratitude towards Brother Mercier, Brother Goad, and all these fine people and their little children, of how kind they have showed us since we’ve been here. The kindness is beyond anything that we expected. And we know that they were lovely and sweet. But we didn’t know that we would be treated in such a real royal way. And, Lord, I pray that Your Presence will always be in this camp of people, the Holy Spirit will fill every heart here, and You will give them Eternal Life. And may we, as we enjoy today, may there be an endless Day that when we’ll meet in the Presence of Him Who we are worshiping and love, and give all praise for these things. Till that time, Lord, keep us loyal to Him and to His Word. In Jesus’ Name we pray. Amen. Now, I had you so long this morning, I’ll try and make it real quick this afternoon, and talk in a way that may be to little fellows, and the older will understand, too. I want to read a Scripture here, found in the Book of Saint Mark, and I want to read from the 17th verse of the 10th chapter of Saint Mark, a portion. And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeling down and asking him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, and that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I done, obeyed, observed (rather) from my youth. Then Jesus beholding him loved him, this young fellow; and he said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasures in heaven: and come, take up thy cross, and follow me. And he was sad at this saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions. Now to the children, and to the adults and all, I want to make this little Message just as timely as I can, and as quick as I can. And I want to take for a text, “follow Me,” and I want to take for a subject: Leadership. Follow, and someone to lead; Leadership, and “follow Me.” The young, the people, the … Remember that, the first step that any of us ever made, somebody led us. You mothers remember the first steps that junior and the little girl made, and they don’t remember it no more. But somebody led you to your first step. I remember Billy Paul when he made his first step, Joseph and all of them, when they made their first step. It’s usually a mother that gets to lead a child to its first step, ’cause she is home while the daddy is out working, trying to make a living. But, it’s, they make their first step. And at nighttime when they come in, the father, he is always saying. “Oh, dad,” she said, “Johnny and Mary,” the little boy or girl, “can walk! Come and look!” And just one step, maybe mother had to hold; had to hold mother’s finger, ’cause you was kind of weak, and kind of turned sideways, you know, and fall down a little. So you had to hold to mama’s hand, to make your first step. Now, somebody helped you, when you made your first step. And your last step you ever make in life, somebody will be leading you. See, that’s right. I want you to remember that. Your first step, somebody led you. And your last step, somebody will be leading you. We have to be led. You know, God likened us unto sheep. And did you know a sheep can’t lead itself? He’ll wander away and stray away, and he just can’t lead himself. And he has to have somebody to lead him. And sometime … The shepherd is supposed to lead the sheep. Now that was back in the days of the Lord Jesus, He was the good Shepherd that led the sheep. But today, you see, we’re living in another day, everything is changed and perverted. You know what man has to lead sheep today? A goat. And you know where that goat leads them? Right into the slaughter. Them little sheep don’t know where they’re going, so the goat goes up a pen, up at the slaughter, and the sheep don’t know no more than to follow a leader, so it leads them right up into this slaughter. And then the goat jumps over the track, and the sheep goes in and gets killed. See, the goat, a wrong leader. But Jesus, the good Shepherd Who led the sheep, He led them to Life and held their hand. See, but somebody has to lead the sheep. The first is the mother’s kindness, then the father’s word. After the mother gives you your first step, then you look to your daddy, all of us, for wisdom, because he is the head of the house. And he usually … Not that he’s any smarter, but he’s just made a leader of his family, so we follow what our daddy says do. When he says, “Now, son, I would like for you to do a certain thing,” then we listen to him because it’s wisdom. But listen, see, he has learned a whole lot and we’ve got to ask him, to see what he learned, and then we can profit by his, what he has learned. He tells us, “Now don’t go and do this, because I did that. My father told me not to do it, but I did it, and it caused this to happen to me, something bad.” So, see, we’ll … Then he, daddy, tells us how to do, and what to do right. Then after mother leads us, till a time we have to get a little wisdom, to understand, from daddy, then we get another. We get another leader, and that’s a teacher, a good school teacher. She tries to teach you and give you an education, to fit you better in life, for a place, a position that you can read your Bible and you can read the songs, and you can learn of God and read, yourself, you see. And then, another thing, maybe you’ll have business, and somebody write you a letter, mama, daddy, somebody write you a letter, you couldn’t read it. See? So the teacher, she has you then, and she leads you to learn to write and to read. And it’s a good thing, a good teacher, to teach you right. But now after you leave that, you, after you leave the teacher, one teacher after the other one, from a little primer, a little first grade, on till you get out of high school or go to college. Then when you leave college, and then the teacher is through leading you. See? Now, mama has taught you to walk, see. Papa has taught you how to be brilliant and a nice young man, and how to take care of yourself and behave yourself. The teacher has taught you an education, how to read and write. But now you are leaving papa, you are leaving mama, and you are leaving the teacher, now somebody has to take you from here on. Now who do you want to take you from here on? [A child says, “Jesus.”] That’s right. Jesus, to take you from there on. Now, that’s a very good answer, very fine. Jesus takes you from there on. Now you see this young fellow that we’re talking about, he is called the rich young ruler. Now, this fellow, he had been guided pretty well. Now, his mother had taught him to walk. And, you see, he was yet a young man, maybe just out of high school, and a very popular young man. And by being well trained, maybe walked correct, and so forth, how his mother had taught him. And he had been a successful young man, too, because, look, he was already rich. And he was just a young man, maybe eighteen years old, just out of high school, and he was rich. Now, you see, he had the right kind of a teacher to teach him to walk right. And he had a right kind of a teacher, his father; till even at yet a young man and he was rich in money, he had made him a lot of money. He might have been a real … He was a ruler, even at that age, very successful. See? And now he had a teacher that had taught him, taught him the right thing, how he would. He had his education. And then another teacher this young man had had, which that depends on how you’re raised up, but this young man had a religious teaching in his home. Now, some children, did you know there is a lot of little children that don’t have any religious teaching at home? Their father and mother don’t believe in God. And their father and mother, drink, smoke, fight, and run out, at one another, at night, and things, and don’t cook their little boy’s and girl’s suppers, and things. Aren’t you glad you got a real good Christian father and mother? Now, when you have children, don’t you want to be the same kind of a father and mother as your father and mother is? See? Now, but that’s all good. Now, this young man had had, and he had a religious teaching. See, that was far beyond what some of them had, ’cause they don’t have religious teaching. But this young man had had religious teaching, because, see, because he said he kept the Commandments since he was a boy. Now you all got good religious teachers, too, each one of you. And you little teen-age girls and boys, you all had good teachers, your father and mother here in this camp, got everything that you … every potential that you know, that’s possible, for you to make a real good man and woman, a servant to God. Because, remember, you’re going to die someday, or either be translated into Heaven. And if you die before His Coming, you will be raptured first. Did you know that? Did you know those who are dead … If mama and papa dies before you do, and Jesus doesn’t come in our generation, do you know these, papa and mama, will come forth first, glorified, before you? See? The trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first, and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them. We’ll be changed like that. We’ve got to remember, that’s the main thing in life. You understand now? That’s the main thing in life, we got to do, is to get ready to meet God. Now, just religion won’t work. See, this one young ruler here, he said, “Good Master … ” Now remember, before I say it. He had been taught to walk right. He had a good education. He had been taught business. And was rich, and was a ruler, and had religion. But he was confronted with another problem, and it confronts all of us, Eternal Life. Religion doesn’t give us Eternal Life. Religious, is a covering, but it don’t give us Eternal Life. And yet, him taught with the best teachers there was, he was yet lacking something. And the young man knew it, because he said, “Good Master, what can I do to inherit Eternal Life?” Now, you, you believe Jesus is God, don’t you? So He knew the thoughts of the young man, so He said, “Keep the Commandments.” He went right back to his religion, to see what he would say about his religion. He said now, in other words, “Keep your religion.” He said, “I have did this, since a boy,” little boys like you. “My mama and papa, and my priest, taught me religion. But I know, in my religion, that I still don’t have Eternal Life.” See? You can be good. Don’t steal. Don’t smoke. Don’t lie. Don’t lie to papa and mama. Don’t tell that first lie, ’cause, one tell one, then it’s easy to tell another one, see. But you mustn’t do that. Don’t tell the first one. Did you know your body is not made to lie? You know, they got a device now, it’s on your nerves. They can put a little band around your wrist here, and put one across your head, and then you can say there, say you say, “I lied about that, but I can say it so easy that they will believe that I’m telling it the truth.” And you can say … They would say, “Was you at a certain place, like did you sit in that Brother Shantz’s trailer, while Brother Branham preached, Sunday afternoon on this day?” And you say, “No, sir. I didn’t sit there. No, sir.” You know what that lie detector will say? “Yes, sir, you did. Yes, sir, you did.” You say, “I did not.” It’ll say, “Yes, you did.” Why? Because a lie is such a horrible thing. The body wasn’t made to lie. And it’s such a horrible thing, till it upsets the whole nerve system, when you lie. Whew! Upset like that, will give you ulcers, fungus growth, it’d kill you. And then a lie is a bad thing, ’cause, see, you’re not supposed to lie, to steal, to do any of these things. Now, so this young man had probably been … he hadn’t lied, he never stole, and he was conscious that he needed ever, Eternal Life. So he said, “What can I do to have It?” And Jesus is showing here now that religion won’t do it. So He sent right back to him, and said, “Keep the Commandments.” He said, “Master, I have did this since I was a little boy, or little, when just a little bitty fellow I did this.” But he knowed he didn’t have Eternal Life. So He said then, “If you would enter into Life, Eternal Life, want to be perfect, then go sell what … ” See, now, it’s all right to have money. See, it’s all right to have money, be rich. And be a ruler, that’s all right. But it’s the way you act after you become that, see. He said, “Go sell what you’ve got, and give it to the poor, them people that hasn’t got anything; then come, follow Me, and you will have treasures in Heaven.” But the young man had so much money till he didn’t know what to do with it. Now, see, he was very popular, that young man was. And he was well equipped for life, the way his father and mother, and the priests and all of them, had equipped him, but still he knowed he was lacking something. Now I’m talking to the adults. He, he knowed he was lacking something, and he didn’t have Eternal Life. He knew it. See? Religion won’t produce Eternal Life. Forms, sensation, you feel something; you could get scared, and feel something. See? Crying, that’s good; shouting, that’s good; but that still ain’t It, see. You are confronted with Eternal Life. You say, “Well, I have been just a staunch Baptist, or Methodist, or Presbyterian, or Pentecostal.” That still isn’t the question. This young man was, too, he was taught in the religion of the day, but he still didn’t have Eternal Life, so he wanted to know what to do. He had been guided successful, to This. But when he was confronted with It, he refused to be guided to Eternal Life, or to be led. His other leaders had had such a hold on him until he didn’t want to turn it loose. See? Now, that is something like what Brother Branham is saying. It’s going a little too deep for you, see. Education is fine, you should go to school and learn. See, that’s good, but that won’t save you. To have plenty of money, that’s good, you could raise your children, give them good clothes and things. And like papa and mama has worked for you all, and things. That’s good, but that still won’t save you. See? Or, you could get in a laboratory and learn how to put different things together, or split atoms, or whatever they do, and get in a rocket and go to the moon, but that won’t save you. You’ve got to face one thing, Eternal Life, and there is only one Person Who can give That to you. Mama can’t give It to you. Papa can’t give It to you. Your pastor can’t give It to you. Your leader here can’t give It to you. Everybody that gets Eternal Life has got to come to Jesus Christ. He is the only One Who can give That part. Your teacher can give you an education, she can teach you; you have to learn it. Your mother can teach you to walk; you have to learn to walk. Your father can teach you how to be a businessman, or what; you have to learn that. But only Jesus can give you Eternal Life. See? Your priest, your leader, or so forth, can teach you your religion, you can learn the Message that we are trying to teach, but still that won’t give you Eternal Life. You’ve got to accept the Person, Jesus Christ. You understand that, all of you? Got to accept the Person, Jesus Christ, to have Eternal Life. Now, but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us till we don’t know what to do then when that time comes. Now, what a fatal thing it is to reject the leadership to Eternal Life, because, see, that’s Life that never can end. Now, the education, that’s fine, that’ll help us here. Business, that’s fine. Money, that’s fine. Be a good boy and girl, that’s fine. But, you see, when life is finished here, that’s all. You understand? You adults understand? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] See, that’s all. But then we’ve got to accept Jesus Christ, for Eternal Life. Jesus alone can lead you to That. And though, see, this young man had achieved all these things in school, and by his parents and everything, he lost the greatest thing that he could have had, the leadership of the Holy Spirit, for Jesus said, “Come, follow Me.” And you girls that’s just getting out of school, you graduate probably, some of you, pretty soon, and you young boys; the greatest leadership there is is Jesus Christ, for that’s the Leadership to Eternal Life. Now, this Leadership confronts every human being, they are given the opportunity to choose. And that’s one great thing we have in life, is to choose. Someday … You know, papa and mama, they chose to have a nice little boy and girl, like you all are. Then, you have a right, after a while, to choose whether you want to learn from the teacher, or not. The teacher can teach you, but you can just be a little bad boy, you just won’t learn; a little, bad girl, won’t listen at all. See, you have a choice to do that, yet you’re little. And mother say, “Did you get A’s on your report card?” “No, I got very poor.” See, now you can … Mother say, “Now you have to study.” And you have to do that then, keep studying like mother told you, like daddy told you. See, you have to study. But you have a choice, you can do it or not do it. You can say, “I don’t want to.” See, you have a choice. After a while, you’ll have a choice of what girl you are going to marry, what boy you’re going to marry. You have a choice everywhere in life. And then you’ve got a choice, again, to whether you want to live after this life; or just be a good, popular person, a movie star, or a dancer, or something another. And look at these little girls here with that pretty voice, a while ago, singing. That child had to cultivate that voice, and she’d be an opera singer, or some singer. I hear these little boys’ voices, these boys, you could be like an Elvis Presley, selling your birthright. See, you don’t want that. See, it’s a talent God gave you, and you’ve got to choose who, where you’re going to use that talent, for God, or whether you’re going to use it for the devil. See? Brother Leo here, your brother, see, now he had a talent, to come and lead people. Now what’s he going to do with it? Is he going into business and make hisself a millionaire; or should he come out here and make a home where people that wants to come together and get all you little children? See, you have to choose what you’re going to do. Each one of us has to make a choice. And it’s confronted to us. But we’re all confronted with this one thing: “What are we going to do about Eternal Life? We going to live hereafter, or not?” Then we have to come to Jesus, to get That. The opportunity of choosing, that’s one thing God gave us. He don’t force nothing on us. He just lets us make our own choice. So you have to not be forced, but just make your own choice. Now let’s just follow this, adults and all now, for a few minutes, and the children, all together. Let’s follow this young man, and the choice that he made, and see where it led him. Now, these girls with that pretty voices, these young boys. Now maybe you come up and be you would have a voice to sing. Now just take that one thing, you could, my, you might someday take it, “I … ” You know this boy called Elvis Presley? You’ve heard my tapes. You’ve heard how I don’t degrade the boy, but that boy was had the opportunity that you all got. See, and what he … He found out he could sing. And watch what he did, just the same thing Judas did, Judas Iscariot, he sold out Jesus. Jesus gave that boy that good voice. And what does he do? Turn around and sell it out to the devil. See, he’s got to come to the end of the road. See? He refused to walk with Jesus. Now this young fellow here, this rich young ruler, he did the same thing. Let’s follow and see what he done. No doubt, with the great man that he was, probably a handsome young man, dark hair combed down on the side, nice clothes. The young ladies thought, “Boy, that’s a handsome young man!” Oh, they would. He would maybe wave at them, and they would flirt back with him, and things. And he thought he was a great fellow, person, see, because he was handsome, he was young. He wasn’t looking down there at the end of the road. He was just looking here. “I’m young. I’m handsome. I’m rich. I can buy anything I want to. I can take these girls, and, boy, they all like me. And they know I’m a great man.” And, see, he had all that. He had followed the instructions of his father, and everything. “And I’m very religious. I go to church.” And now he could follow that, see; very popular, rich, and famous. And, and he … Just like today, like you had the opportunity to become a movie star, see, or something like that. Most young kids today, you talk to them, they know more about these movie stars than they know about Jesus. You see? And, see, you children are learning about Jesus. Where they sit down, and some play come on on a movie, or something another, they know the actors and all there, all about it. They know all that better than That. You tell them about the Bible, they don’t know nothing about Bible. See, it’s making the wrong choice. Now, some singer selling their God-given talent, for fame! Then we see him at life’s end. Let’s follow him a little further. You know what the Bible says about this young fellow? He become more successful. So, sometimes success don’t mean that you’ve made the right choice. You know what he did? He went out and had all big times, and throwed big parties, and spent lots of money and everything, on the girls and everything. And then he got married and maybe had a family. And he just increased so much till he had to build new barns and things. And he said, “You see, I didn’t follow Jesus, and look what I got!” See? You may hear people say that, and I have, “Well, look, He’s blessed me.” That don’t mean it all. See? And after a while his barns swelled till even he said, why, even, “Soul, take your rest. I’ve got so much money and so much success! And I’m such a great man! I belong to all the clubs. And I have the riches of the world in my hands. I own great sums of land and sums of money, and, why, my, there everybody likes me, a very fine person to be.” But you know, the Bible said that, that night, God said to him, “I’m going to require your soul.” Then what did happened? Now there was a beggar, a poor old Christian that laid out there by his gate. And just when they … Up in Jerusalem, over there, they eat up on top of the house. And the bread crumbs fall off like this, and the pieces of meat, and so forth, hit the floor when they drop them. And they don’t pick them up, because everything in Jerusalem, the old city, it’s … Is it all right to say a little joke here? They’re f-o-b. You know what that is? Flies on the bread, flies on the beef, flies on the butter, f-o-b, flies on everything. They get out in the street, in the gutters and everything, and fly in and get right up on it. So these people up there, they get up on top of the building. And they eat, and then they drop this off, and then they sweep that off. And the dogs, in the streets, eats the crumbs. And he let this poor old Christian lay there in the street and just eat the crumbs that dropped from his plate from his bed, or from his table. And then when he got in, after a while, he had sores, and he didn’t have anything to put on his sores. His name was Lazarus. And the dogs come and licked his sores so he could try to get well. Well, you know, after a while, this rich man, when, he saw he had money to buy all kinds of medicine, if he got sick, have all kinds of doctors. But, you know, sometimes doctors can’t help us, medicine won’t help us, nothing can help us; we’re at the mercy of God. And he come down to the end of his road; the doctors couldn’t help him, and the nurses couldn’t help him, and medicine couldn’t help him, and he died. And then when his soul left his body, see, it left all of his money, all of his education, everything that he had, all of his popularity. They give him a great big funeral, maybe half-masted the flag, and the mayor of the city come, and they, and the preacher come and said, “Our brother now has gone to Glory,” and all like that. But the Bible said, that, “He lifted up his eyes in hell, in torment, and looked way across that great gulf there, and seen that beggar that had been laying, there in his door, over in Heaven. And he cried, ‘Send Lazarus down here with a little water. These flames are tormenting.’ Said, ‘Oh, no. See, you took the wrong choice in life.’” See, when he come to the end of the road, to step out of life! He had been led by religion. He had been led by education. He had been led by the influence of his success. But, you see, he had nothing to hold his hand, those things end there. You understand, little fellow? You adults do. What I’m … See, he had nothing to hold him. His money couldn’t hold him. His friends with the doctors couldn’t hold him. Medicine couldn’t hold him. His priest, his religion, couldn’t hold him. So, there was only one thing for him to do. He had refused to accept Jesus, Eternal Life. So what did he have to do? Sink down into death, into hell. What a fatal mistake that young man had when he refused to walk with Jesus, be led by Jesus. He refused to do it. So many young people are making that mistake, today, refusing to be led by the Lord Jesus. Now we see what a fatal thing it is to refuse Eternal Life and be led by Jesus, a Leadership, when He said, “Come, follow Me.” See what this handsome little man said this afternoon? When you get out of school, when you get away from, you need another leader, but let that be Jesus. And Jesus is the Bible. Do you believe that? This is Jesus’ Life and His Commandments to us, in letter form. So we have to look into This, to see. This is the blueprint. This is the map that He told us to follow, to begin Eternal Life. Now we find out that this young man was lost. Now let’s take another. Would you like, would you have time to take another rich young ruler, that made the right move? Would you like to hear that? All right, we’ll try it now. Now let us take another rich young ruler who was confronted with the same thing. Now we see where that boy went, that lived a pretty good life, but died and was lost in hell. And now here we’re going to talk about another young man who was confronted with the same thing. He was a rich man, a young man, and was a ruler, and, but he accepted the leadership of Christ; like the little boy told us a while ago, that we should let lead us. He accepted it. The Scripture for this is found, if you want to look it up after I get through, see, is in Hebrews, the 11th chapter, and the 23rd to the 29th verse. Let me just read It. Is that all right? You’ll bear with me just a little bit, won’t you? You don’t mind if I don’t, will you? See? So we just … We’ll just read this, then you say, “I heard Brother Branham read this out of the Bible.” See? And you know it’s there then. It wasn’t what I said, it’s what He said. Now you listen here, of what the Bible said here of this nice fellow, see. Now look. By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment. By faith Moses, when he … come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; (listen) Choosing rather to suffer the affliction with the people of God, than to suffer the pleasures of sin for a season; Esteeming the reproach of Christ … Way back in Moses’ time, it was still Christ. See? He is the only One has Eternal Life. See? “Esteeming the reproach,” to be called a fanatic, holy-roller, or something like that, you know. See? Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of … reward. Now you know what that means? It means this, that, Moses was borned a poor boy, real poor. His father’s name was Amram. His mother’s name was Jochebed. And they were real poor, but they were Christians. They worked hard. They was in slavery. They had to make mud bricks, and things, for the old king. You know what? That king’s daughter went down, one day, to the river where mother … Moses’ mother, Jochebed, had taken him and put him in a little raft out on the river like that. And the old crocodiles had eaten up all the little babies; and they were killing them, throwing them out into the river. But she put him right out there. And you know how she got them crocodiles away from him? She made this little ark she put him in, she made it out of pitch. You know what that is? It’s turpentine. An old ’gator would come up, say, “Hum, a little fat Hebrew, I’ll get him!” Hear him crying like that. Went over there, “Whew! What a smell! Uh!” See? See, the mother was led, how to protect her baby. So he backed off from it, he didn’t want nothing to do with that. And then he went on down the river, a little farther. And his little sister, named Miriam, followed him down the river, watched what … And then Pharaoh’s daughter come out and was going to get him, you know, and she pulled him out. You know, all … You know, your mother thinks you’re the prettiest child in the world; see, she should do that. But the Bible said this little boy was really pretty, really a fair little boy. And, oh, he was just screaming and kicking his little heels. He was missing his mama, see. And so you know what happened? Then God put in Pharaoh’s daughter, the king’s daughter, all the love that a mother could have for a little baby. Her heart just fell for him. She said, “That’s my baby.” But, you know, she was a young woman. See, them days they didn’t have these bottles that you, the babies, was raised on, so they had to go get a mother that was, had had a baby, and had, that could nurse. So Miriam was right there on hand, she said, “I’ll go get you the right mother.” “Well, you go get her.” You know who Miriam went and got? Moses’ own mother. That’s right. Yeah, went and got. That was wisdom, wasn’t it? And so then went and got Moses’ own mother. And she said, “I’ll take and raise the little boy for you.” She said, “You know what, I’m going to give you three hundred dollars, a week, to raise that baby. And you can stay in the palace.” See how God does when you trust Him, see, when you’re sure of faith. That baby was a prophet, see, and she knowed. So they went into the palace and she raised Moses, and the mother, the own mother, and got three hundred dollars, a week, to take care of everything. Just think of that! And then, you know, after a while, after that went on for a little while, Moses begin to get old enough to read and write. She taught him how to read and write. And then she told him, said, “Moses, you are borned a correct child. Your father and I have prayed. God has revealed to us that you’re a prophet, and you’re going to be a deliverer of the people, in the days that is to come.” And you know, when he got big, then what was he? He was adopted into the king’s family. Oh, my! He didn’t have to … And he looked out on his own people, and they didn’t have no clothes. They were Christians, and they were crying. And them old taskmasters whipping them with whips, and the blood fly out of their back. His cousins and uncles, papa and mama, all of them; whipping them with whips, out there in them mud pits. And so, but Moses, being something way down in his heart, he knew that they were God’s promised people. He knew it. Now, the next thing he was going to do was to become king. He would be king over everything, a rich man, my, all the money of Egypt. And Egypt controlled the world, at that time. But, look, the Bible said, “he esteemed the reproach,” to be a mud dauber like out there, a Christian. When they made fun of them, and laughed at them, kicked them. If they said anything back, they killed them. See? But Moses chose to go with that group instead of being called the king’s son. Look at that! See, because he seen the end time! See that rich young man? But he seen Jesus, like we see Him in a vision, that the end time is what is going to pay. Now, and he accepted Christ’s leadership, and Moses esteemed the reproach greater treasures. You know, sometime when you little boys in school, little boys will say bad words and they want you all to say them. You little girls; the little girls will say bad things and want you all to say them. You say, “No. I’m a Christian.” They say, “Ah, you big sissy!” You know, go onto you like that. See, stand up, say, “I’m glad to be that.” See? Cause, see, that’s what Moses did. He esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all of Egypt. Now let us follow him, led by Christ, and see what he did. Now, see, this young man was rich, the first young man, but he didn’t want Christ. He didn’t want to be a follower of Jesus. And so we find him very popular, perhaps become a movie star, and great everything, in all the things that he could do, and everything he wanted. But when he died, he didn’t have anybody to lead him. So, his education, that was good; his money, that was good; but when death come, that was all, he couldn’t use it no more. He couldn’t buy his way up to Heaven. And he couldn’t, by his education, he couldn’t go to Heaven. See? But this young man now, he had all these things. He had education, too. He’s smart. He went to school with his … His mother taught him, and he had a good education. And he was real smart, till, even he could teach the Egyptians. He taught his teacher, he was so smart. Look how smart he was. But, you know what, above all that smartness, above all that he had, the potentials he had, he still said, “I’ll forsake it all, to follow Jesus.” You know what they done with him? They run him out. He become a mud slave like the rest of them. But one day when he become a grown man, he was herding sheep on the back side of the desert. And what happened? Anybody tell me what happened? What was it? [A child says, “There was a Fire in the bush.”] That’s right, there was a Fire in the bush, and It attracted his attention. He turned aside. And you know what? You said, “Teach the children.” Now the children going to get up and teach me. [Brother Branham laughs.] So, and this little boy here, he is right on the mark. Who is your daddy? [The child says, “Mr. Shantz.”] Mr. Shantz is your daddy. That boy has been taught, hasn’t he? Each one of them little bright eyes looking the same way, one to get ahead of the other one, you see. So now look, he did, and that bush attracted him, on fire, and he said, “I will turn aside and see what it is.” And God said to Moses, “Take off your shoes, the ground you’re standing on is holy. I have chosen you to go down and deliver My people. I’m giving you power; you can smite the earth with plagues, you can turn the water into blood, you can bring fleas and lice. Nothing is going to harm you. I’ll choose you.” Why? Because he chose Christ. See? You choose Christ, and He chooses you. See? Now He said, “You chose Me, and I have chose you to go down there in Egypt.” And look what he done. He led two million people, two million people out, his people, and brought them into the promised land. And, now, he followed. We follow him all through the wilderness; and you children has heard Brother Leo and Brother Gene, and your papa and mama, tell you what all taken place in the wilderness, how he brought bread down out of heaven and fed the hungry people, and all these things. And now we find out, he is an old man now, he’s real old, he is one hundred and twenty years old. And he is in the wilderness. And the people didn’t treat him nice, even. See, sometimes people that call themselves Christians don’t treat you nice. But Jesus always treats you right. See? See? So we find now that the people rebelled against him, but he stayed right with them, anyhow. And he was the leader, and he had to stay with them. And the Angels of the Lord talked to him. Wouldn’t you love to have that happen to you? Then make the right choice, and choose Jesus, and He’ll do it. Now, then we find out, the end of the road, he got real old. He couldn’t preach no more, and his voice got low. So he blessed Joshua, and went up on top the hill, to die. You know what happened when he died? There, what, what happened? [A boy says, “He died, and then He raised him from the dead.”] That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. Now you say, “Where is that at?” Now, just a minute, the boy is right, see. He was raised up from the dead. Now, and …?… See? See? Now look. He raised him up from the dead. Why? Because, eight hundred years later, here he was over in Palestine, standing with his Leader yet, Jesus, who esteemed the reproach of His Name greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt. He esteemed … His Leader was standing there. You know, He was called … In the Bible, you know, there was a Rock that went with Israel. And when Moses got ready to die, he stepped up on this Rock. And that Rock was Jesus. You remember when Jesus was talking, and in Saint John, the 6th chapter? Well, he said, “Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness!” Said, said, “My Father gave you that manna.” He said, “Yeah, they eat manna. That’s right. And they’re, every one, dead, because they wouldn’t keep on going on, see.” Said, “They’re, every one, dead.” But said, “I am the Bread of Life that come from God out of Heaven.” “Our fathers drank from a Rock. Moses smote the Rock,” and said, “and the waters came forth.” He said, “I am that Rock that was with him.” And look, when Moses died, he stepped onto that Rock. You know what happened? The Bible said that “Angels” come and got him. What a difference from that other young man! That young man, see, when he died, he didn’t have nobody to hold him, so he just sank down through the darkness, into hell, and he’s there now, there. Then when Moses stepped out of life, when he went, he had took a Leader. His mama led him right, his father taught him right. And then when he got to be of age, a young man, then he said, “I see Eternal Life, if I will go down with these poor, neglected people, and walk with them, because they are God’s people. I don’t have to. I could be a king, but I don’t want to be a king. I can have all the money there is in Egypt, ’cause I’m going to be owner of it. I don’t want it. I would rather walk with Jesus,” and then when he walked through life. And then when he started to step out of life, there was his Leader that takes him by hand. Don’t you want that Leader? Don’t we all want that Leader to hold him by His hand? Hundreds of years later, he was seen with his great Leader. He had led. He made the choice, of his youth, and so therefore God was holding him. You know what? The rich man is in hell, that one young rich man that refused. See, now remember, he had education, he had religion, he went to church, he was a good man, but he refused Jesus. See? And this young man, he was educated, and he had religion, but he wanted Jesus. See, Moses would have been a much richer man than this young fellow would have been, ’cause he just had some money, probably farms and things like that, and maybe politics and so forth, but Moses was to be king over the earth. And he forsook all of that. And you know what, children? When there is no Egypt, and when there is no treasures, there will still be a Moses, because he chose the right thing. See? He chose the right thing to lead him. When there is no more big pyramids! You read about the pyramids in Egypt? One of these days, they’ll be dust, under the atomic bomb. All the riches of the world, people will throw it in the air, and scream, and say it’s cankered into their flesh, and scream and howl. See, it will pass away. But them who accept Jesus to lead them, they’ll never die. They have Eternal Life. Though they die naturally here, Jesus will raise them up again. You must make a choice. Your choice will determine what your eternal destination will be. Remember, Jesus asks each one of us, “Follow Me if you want Life.” See, leadership, “Follow Me. You’ll have everlasting Life.” And I’m sure, even to us adults, we get something out of this, too. If you want Life, you have to accept It. You want religion, you accept it. If you want … What you have to do, what you accept, that’s what you’ll get. But to me and to you, and to these little children, remember, you have an invitation. Jesus said, “Follow Me, and have Eternal Life.” That’s what we want to do, don’t we? Now how many of you wants to really follow Jesus, and you say, “Well, well, when I get big enough and old enough to make my choice, and to do what … I don’t care how much money I got, how poor I am, how much people laugh at me, or everything else, I want to follow Jesus. I want to make Moses’ choice, not the rich young man”? How many wants to do that right here? Now you really want to do it? I want you to stand up with me. I want you to put your left hand on your heart, and you hold your right hand up. I want you to close your eyes now and bow your head, and just say these words after me. [The congregation repeats each phrase after Brother Branham, in the following prayer.] Dear Jesus, [“Dear Jesus,”] I pledge my life to You. [“I pledge my life to You.”] I have heard this sermon, [“I have heard this sermon,”] where two young men made their choice. [“where two young men made their choice.”] I do not want to go the way of the rich young ruler. [“I do not want to go the way of the rich young ruler.”] But I do want to go the way of Moses. [“But I do want to go the way of Moses.”] I am just a child, yet. [“I am just a child, yet.”] Lead me, Dear Jesus, [“Lead me, Dear Jesus,”] to Eternal Life. [“to Eternal Life.”] Amen. [“Amen.”] Now you bow your head. Dear Jesus, one day, in Your pilgrimage here on earth, they brought to You such little fellows as I have been speaking to this afternoon. And the disciples said, “The Master is too tired. He preached this morning. He preached, this and that, and He is too tired. Don’t trouble Him.” But, Jesus, You said, “Suffer the little children to come to Me, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.” Lord God, today receive these little boys and girls here, in this school of righteousness, here where our brother has come apart into the side of the wilderness here, to bring out the families that desire to separate themselves from the things of the world, to sojourn only for You. And now their little ones are here, watching the lives of their father and mother, as we are examples in all that we do. O Dear God, Creator of Heavens and earth, guide our feet, Lord, that we’ll not do nothing before these little ones, that would put a stumbling block in their way. For it is said, it would be better that we have a millstone tied at our neck, and be cast into the sea, than to offend one of these little ones. You said, “Their Angels always behold My Father’s face which is in Heaven,” the great Angel, and guardian Angel, over each of these little souls. As they sat this afternoon with their little eyes wide open, looking and answering the questions, and listening at the little baby stories of the Bible, of how these two young man took their choices, and each one of them dedicating their lives to You. O Jehovah God, lead them, protect them. And may they find this great Leader, Jesus Christ, that will lead them when father and mother and the teachers are finished with them. May You lead them to Eternal Life, as You did to Moses, as their humble, little, child prayer went to You. I give them to You, Lord, as Your servant, as trophies and gems for Your crown. Use them, Lord, to honor You, on earth. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. And you little ones, fellows, can … Now you feel better about it now? You know Jesus is going to lead you and guide you. Don’t you believe that? And Jesus is going to make you little boys just like Moses and Miriam, the prophetess and the prophet, He’ll make great people out of you. Now, we older people, that have accepted Him, don’t we want Him to lead us on, too? I want Him to lead me on, guide my feet, hold my hand. See? And even when I come down to the river, I want to have a hold of His hand. We all want that, don’t we? Dear Jesus, lead us, too, Father. Now we’re fixing to separate from each other. I must go back to Tucson. I must get ready for the meetings coming. God, I commit this group of people, Brother Leo and Brother Gene, and all the followers here, into Your hands, that You will bless them and love them, forgiving all their iniquities, healing all of their diseases, keeping them ever in love and fellowship, and encouraging those who would have … be get weary. And sometime Satan might come along and cause them to be discouraged, but, remember, You went through the same thing, discouragement, forsaken by men of this earth, and people. And sometimes very dearest of friends, even to relationships, we’re forsaken. But there is One that we have chosen, He will never leave us or forsake us. Lead us, Lord, to Life Eternal. I pray that You will grant that we can come together many more times, on earth, and speak of Thee and talk of Thee. And then in that great Day, when the world is finished and all the time has faded into Eternity, may we meet in that great Kingdom, as unbroken families, to live together hereafter forever. Grant it, Lord. Until then, may we work, labor with all of our might, while the sun is still shining. For we ask it in Jesus’ Name. Amen. God bless each one of you. [Blank spot on tape.] By His counsel guide, uphold you, With His arms securely fold you; God be with you till we meet again! Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus’ feet; Till we meet! till we meet! (Thank you, brother.) God be with you till we meet again! God bless you all. 
Thank you, Brother Green. It’s a privilege. A greeting to Brother and Sister Green, and all that’s here this morning. And it is a privilege that I feel I have given to me, to come to this place of worship, to make a few announcements. I don’t want to take Brother Green’s time here, because I heard Brother Green several times, speak, and I certainly was influenced, and as he brought the Word of the Lord to us, and so humble about it. Yesterday he said, “I don’t get the Word from the Lord as maybe It would come in revelation, as It’s been sent, but,” said, “I like to stress upon what has been said.” He said, “Like when Paul wrote something in the Bible, I come here to stress upon what he said.” Said, “I have no message, only just to stress on what’s already been said from the Lord.” Now that was really remarkable, a young fellow like that, and say, make a remark like that. Now let’s just have a word of prayer together. Dear God, I hardly know how to start, for I feel You are here today, and in Your Presence we always feel so little. And I thank You for this privilege. Now, Lord, that Thou has granted this place to us, we pray that You will meet with us every time that we meet here. And may Your Great Spirit move over this city! May we be able to bring this Gospel Message that has been given to us and presented to our hands in this last days, may It be fulfilled, and You get every soul out of Tucson and around about, that You’ve ordained to Life. Grant these things, Father, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I think I want to read a little verse of Scripture here this morning, just before I say these words that I wish to say. It’s found over in Acts, the 7th chapter of the Book of Acts. And while you’re turning to that, we’ll begin at the 44th verse. Now we’re going to Shreveport this week, this coming week, for a series of services, and now we’re going to try, if the Lord willing. Brother Moore, Brother Jack Moore, a very good friend of both Brother Pearry and I, and we love Brother Jack. The Message, I think, kind of baffled him a little, especially on some of the things that we hold dear and believe, that It came to us through the opening of the Seven Seals, as we believe It, such as, “serpent’s seed,” and “Eternal security of the believers,” and so forth, some of those Messages. That, maybe to others … We don’t think This is hard, but, It, you’ve got to open your heart to Truth. We believe that we’re living in the end time. That’s just so real to us, that we’re just at the end of the road. And to speak in some other man’s church, well, you want to honor that man’s hospitality, of giving you that opportunity to come into his church. And I, certainly, knowing that they don’t believe in That, and I would honor them enough that … There is plenty more that I can speak on there, besides bringing That in; unless it’s just the Holy Spirit happen to push It a little, you see, then I would certainly say as He said. And I don’t know no better than to do that, and I hope I never learn any better than to do that. See? Let’s just say It the way He says It. Now let us read just a verse or two here out of the 7th chapter of the Book of Acts, beginning with the 44th verse. Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he has appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. Which also our father that came after brought in with Jesus unto the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But Solomon built him a house. Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, Heaven is my throne, … earth is my footstool: what house will you build me: saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? Has not my hands made all these things? Upon This, the reading of this Scripture, I want to say the few words that I want to say before Brother Pearry brings the morning message. I find this one of the great moments of my visit to Tucson. I come here because that I was led to come here. I come here because that the Holy Spirit, through a vision, sent me here. I know that might seem strange, maybe. But He, as far as I know, anything that I know of God, I was sent by a vision to Tucson. I’ve wondered how I ever was sent to this desert place. And then here where there is … Spiritually speaking, over the city, I don’t know of any place that’s any more spiritual dead, than in the city of Tucson. There is war between the churches. There is fusses between the congregations. There is no unity, and everyone grabbing, and holding, and squeezing, and trying to get this one, and proselyting. It is a desert, spiritually speaking, also. But then I read in the Bible, that where God called Moses away from his loved ones and all that was dear to him, and sent him into the wilderness, to write the Laws of the Bible. That was the Old Testament, the first four Books, Genesis, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, Exodus. He … I never said them just in routine, but that’s four Books. That really is the Old Testament. Because, the rest of It was what the prophets said, in the Psalms of David, and so forth, but the Chronicles of the kings. But this was the fundamentals of the Old Testament. Was Moses wrote them after he was called from his homeland, where he had been born and brought up among his people, and was sent into the desert, to write this Book of the Old Testament. Then I find that in the Book of the New Testament, where Paul, which is the author, or not the author, but the writer of the New Testament. He also was drove out from among his people, and, by the Spirit, into Arabia, where he was three and a half years, to find the inspiration. And Paul is the chief writer of the New Testament. Now, there is Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but they were scribes that just wrote what Jesus said as they followed Him along. And, but, you take the Book to Timothy, and to the Romans, and to the Hebrews, and so forth, Paul received inspiration to write the New Testament; taking all the Old Testament as a shadow, and setting it in order. And God honored it, and made it the New Testament. And now if the Old Testament had to be drove from the … the writer had to be drove from his people, into the wilderness, to get inspiration to write the Old Testament. And in the New Testament, the writer was drove by the Author, into a desert place, to get the inspiration to write the New Testament. And the Books are sealed with Seven Seals; it would also require the same, I believe, in these days, to open those Seven Seals. To leave what you hold dear, to what you cherish, and a little home that was given me by the people, and amongst all my people and friends, and a church that was flourishing, and had nothing lacking; and to leave that, pull right away from it, and move away, out into a desert where you knew nobody, and everything against you. But there is something about God, that He drives a man to do things that’s beyond any thinking of his own, so it can be to the glory and honor of God. And I feel that, not self honor, but I feel it a privilege that it was to leave everything that was called dear to me, to get here into this wilderness and suffer like I have never suffered in my life, here in this wilderness, or this desert. But I believe, that in doing that and obeying what God commanded to be done, God has opened to us the mysteries of this last day. And we are here with this Message. Now, there was many people who followed me, and that’s not unusual. Usually a person we … The people love one another, and it, love, will drive you to do things you don’t think you would do. And many of you left your homes, you left all, just to go, come out here in the desert. Many has called me, many has asked me, “Shall we come to Arizona? Would it be a good place for us?” Well, as it was said about Moses and them, it was no place of fruit, no place of pomegranate. Here there is not much work to do, and living is high, and the cost of living is high. It’s really a rough place to live, is Tucson, Arizona; wages are poor, and food is high, and rent. It’s a horrible place to live, in that manner. But it’s healthy, it’s dry. And we sometimes … We mustn’t get our minds fashioned on things of this earth. We must look to the leading of the Holy Spirit. But one thing that troubled me in coming here, and telling people, well, “you should not come” or “you should come,” that I leave up to each individual, the way God leads that individual to do. I think every one of us should do that, be led by the Spirit, on what to do. And many of you here are from around Jeffersonville, and of the congregation there, and you have come out here. Now, the thing that bothered me, was a place of worship. And I realize, as I read in the Scripture here, of Stephen and his address just before his death; for they stoned him immediately afterwards, for his message. As he was speaking, he said, “our fathers,” talking of the Hebrews in the early days, how that they tried to find favor before God, to build a place for worship. He said that, “Solomon built Him a house, or a building.” We are acquainted with the story. But I like his next words, “Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in houses that’s made with hands,” and another place over in Isaiah. He said, “‘A body has Thou prepared Me; see, sacrifice and offerings, and buildings, and so forth, but a body has Thou prepared Me.’” Well, we realize that he was speaking then of the body where God tabernacled, in Christ. But I believe today, that the inspiration that’s come to Brother Green, to move here, him and Sister Green, giving up their place back in the east, also, too, back in Texas, to come here with … to start with nothing; just simply by an inspiration, feeling that they should do it. I appreciate men that will follow the leading of Christ, regardless of the cost it costs them. Though the whole world, maybe your very best friends, think that you’re wrong, but it isn’t wrong to you. As long as you feel there is something behind it, it’s God moving you; it’s never wrong, and it’ll always pan out right. See this young couple, a talented young man. I ain’t saying this because he is sitting here. And this young lady with her babies, with his family to raise, and he has quit his job and everything, to move here. I realize that years ago I was called in the ministry. I’ve never made a successful pastor, because I got a roaming, rambling spirit. I can’t be satisfied anywhere. Just wherever the Spirit moves, I’ve just got to move with It, because I have a Message. Jesus said, “I must preach in this other town also.” But there are those who are shepherds that watch the flock. I’m so grateful that Brother Pearry followed the leading of the Holy Spirit, and today we have a tabernacle. It’s a small one. That’s just good enough to start with, to see what the Holy Spirit … Not knowing, let’s just move step by step. Now, I believe, if God has spoke to Brother and Sister Green, to come here, and has opened up a place where our children; instead of on Sunday morning riding their bicycles, and on the streets and running around, they have a place to come to worship, instead of us sitting around and listening to something that we’ve heard on radio, which is all right. But we, as this group of people, we have a Message for this day. We, we believe that God has given us a Message. And Brother Green, is, I don’t want to call him my associate, because we are … Well, it is, also, my associate, we are together in this Message. Brother Green preaches the same thing and Message that I believe in. He has left his home, he has left his people, he has left his church. He was, I believe, he was a district superintendent or something, of one of the organizations, and give the whole thing up when he heard This. He left everything that was dear to him, also, to come to the desert, just to support what God is giving to us now. I say I believe it’s not only should be in our hearts, it should be our duty to back him up, everything that we can, to attend the services, to come here to worship, and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that He has for us to reveal. And as his word said, “The Message doesn’t come to me through the giving of the inspiration, as it does to maybe to some of us, but,” he said, “I am here to back up what God has given.” What a statement! And I believe, if we will all cooperate together, we’ll put our hearts to it. I know that each one of you, if you feel like I do, I am so hungry to see the Spirit of God moving, I just can’t hardly stand it. Some experiences I’ve just had up in the mountain, just to feel that once again, that Something that when I was first saved was so glorious to my heart! And we can come into a place, we can sit and we see it among us, that we are drying. As we sit here in the desert, I get among my brethren, they talk with me and I talk with them; always, in a little way of watching, feeling out there with the Spirit, as it was, to see just the condition of that brother, to see what’s wrong. I begin to feel us all reclining, getting away from the Spirit. It’s become too natural a thing to us. We must worship in the Spirit, where the Spirit of God … Not only our Message should be the flame of the hour, it should be the flame in our hearts. See? It’s got to be in our hearts, or we can’t rightly present It to the people. The Spirit has to pack the Message, Itself. And I’m trusting and believing in every one of you, to be a real Christian. Now they need Sunday school teachers. They’re going to need a staff. And I want to say this so that you will thoroughly understand. This is my church. I been here three years. And I’ve had one door open to me, that was Brother Mack asked me to come preach. God bless him. I haven’t been invited by any other people; not nothing against them, they’re alright. Brother Brock, a good friend of mine, Brother Gilmore, many of these Pentecostal brethren here, are very, very deep good friends of mine. I love them; nothing against them. I understand their position. They can’t invite me in there, and then remain in their organization. See, they can’t do it. Because, if they do, they’re kicked out. So you see their position. I had the same thing to face. But, my, may it always be, “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God,” the will of God. And now that, Brother Green, God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious Faith that we believe in, we ought to be very grateful to God, and attend every service, take every place that we can. And if we’re asked to call on, to pray, to seek, to do, let’s be soldiers right at the … just anxious to do it. See? Keep the Message honorable, and live the right kind of life. Don’t let no smut come upon It. We’re living too late now. We’re too late in the hour. Let’s live It clean. Well, my life, your life, all of our lives needs to be picked up, before God. Our young people just ride around, from place to place, from show to show, and drifting further and further away from God. Right. Now, that’s the truth. I see it in my children, and I see myself getting to a place where not … You, you’ve got to assemble ourselves together, to worship God; the Bible said so, “When we see this day approaching, that much more come together.” If there is only two people here, you be one of them. Now that’s … And if we come together and worship together, then we just, something another about it, Jesus said, “Where two or three are gathered in My Name, there I am in their midst.” Now, as I’ve said before, Brother Green told me, and he said it. My wife come, told me what he said when I was away. That, and he said this morning, “The pulpit was open at any time.” Now usually … That’s, open for me to speak. Now, usually, I had to drive all the way to Jeffersonville, Indiana, to give a Message that God gave me, to bring it to the people; go all the way to Jeffersonville, Indiana, and each one of you stringing across the country, and hooking up the wires and things, to get the Message, because that’s what we’re living on. See, that’s what we’re here for. Well, we don’t have to do that no more. God gives me a Message, I can walk right here to the pulpit and preach it, and feel free to do it. Yeah. And I believe, by that, that God Almighty will bless you if you will just stand by this church now, this group of people. Not only that, but let’s go out and see if we can’t get others to come in. See, let’s speak to others everywhere, speak to them about our church and what it means. What our church … We’re here. We want you to come, bring in strangers, and I’m sure it will be good for all of us. See? We have a building, which we are thankful for. We’re thankful for this place, to gather together. But, “Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, see, ‘For Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool; and where is the place of My rest? But a body has Thou prepared Me.’” And we are a Body of Christ. So as we move from one building to another building, I believe, in bringing our Messages, and we’ll come down and have healing services. And anything the Lord reveals to us to do, we’ll have it right here in the church, until it swells out so big you’ll have to take it somewhere else, and somewhere else, until Jesus comes. God bless you. [Brother Pearry Green comments, and then asks for Brother Branham to ordain him. Blank spot on tape.] Let’s bow our heads. Dear God, as we stand here on this platform, which represents, right over the altar here, we realize that we are a dying race of people, as far as this earth is concerned. We look out upon the streets and see sin wrote everywhere, and that the Glory of the Lord is swiftly departing. And we know, when the Glory of the Lord goes up, so will the Church go with It. God, we want to be there. Just a few days ago, standing here on the street corner, just across the street, watching that parade go down the street; and seeing those old First War tanks leading the way, then come the big heavy Sherman tank, behind that followed on and on and on, then the gold-star mothers; the little broke-up family, with a crying wife, and a little ragged boy lost his daddy, an old mother had lost a son. I thought, “How sad,” to stand on the street corner and watch something like that pass. Then noticing, just as they passed this building, the music changed to Onward, Christian Soldiers. Playing their marches, behind; but when they passed this spot! Dear God, I’m thinking of another great time coming, and that will be the resurrection, when the old-timers will come forth first, saints, the patriarchs. “For we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep; for the trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” Then when we see that great … just the people going, marching up through the skies; and we’ll be standing, waiting for our change, knowing that we’ll fall in line, also. God, make us faithful soldiers. Only those who have really associated and been in the war would know what that really meant, to see those tanks rolling by. And, God, we think that those who have been in the battle of life will know what it means, when we’re waiting our turn to fall in position and place, in the resurrection, to go up. And this, my young brother, standing here, well trained, ready, dressed, waiting for an old man to lay hands upon him, one who is an old veteran from up there in the front line, knowing that he must join the battle, too. Dear God, with these unworthy hands I lay upon my brother, in representation of Yours. Bless Brother Green, dear God, who I bless in Jesus’ Name. May he carry this Message, Lord, into this city and wherever You’ll call him. May he be loyal, filled with the Spirit, living a life above reproach. God, let him have the hearts of the people, that he might teach them and lead them and direct them in the path that we all desire to walk. Grant it, Lord. Bless his faithful wife, his little children. Bless our efforts here together, as Christian brothers here on earth, that we may carry this Gospel to the ends of the world. Send Your Spirit upon him, God. We pray in Jesus Christ’s Name, as we give him to You. Amen. God bless you, Brother Pearry. Carry the Word of God! 
I canceled a hunting trip, so I keep service to the Lord. So it’s a … We’re glad to be here. I believe, the last time here, I told you: each time we come, there is someone missing. And if we shall come back next year, and the Lord tarries, there’ll be somebody missing. There’s one, was very, very close to me in heart, spirit; that was Brother Lyle. I’ve always had a welcoming, coming in, standing back there and listen, in Brother Jack’s study, of the old quartet singing. They’re singing in Glory, tonight. Well, there’s one of those voices already over There, waiting for the other three. I guess I’ll never hear it here on earth no more. But I certainly am looking forward to hearing it again, Brother, Sister Moore here, in that Land where they’ll … it’ll never be dimmed. Brother Palmer was a great servant of Christ. I can remember Brother Jack telling me about his dedicated life to God. They were carpenters, together. And said he would be eating his lunch, have his sandwich in his hand, eating a sandwich and reading his Bible. See? He done some mighty great things, Brother Palmer did. He’s a good carpenter, a good father to his children, a lovely family. He raised them all to serve the Lord. As far as I know, they’re all saved and filled with the Holy Ghost. And that’s a great contribution to any man in these days, boys and girls. But, see, all that he ever done won’t amount to too much until serving God, lest he served God. And tonight, what he had done here on earth, his good deeds, he’s gone to his reward, to be with them. God rest the soul of our brother. I know, as long as this is a tabernacle here, and I know he’ll … his voice will still be here. You can hear it. Sister Anna Jeanne and her sister, playing the organ and piano, how they never had to wait. Brother Palmer just stand here and he just pick the song up, go on. They’d catch it. And I never … I looked forward to hearing him lead the song. To his children; to his wife; and to Brother Jack, his bosom friend, they been friends for all these years; and Brother Brown, Sister Brown, and all you tabernacle: God bless you. I miss him, too. God rest his gallant soul, until we meet him in peace. Let us bow our head. Gracious Heavenly Father, just speaking of this great servant, I missed him, tonight, him shaking my hands, and that cunning little smile he always had when he said, “God bless you, Brother Branham,” when we’d walk in the door. I know he’s come up to Your House, tonight. So I pray, dear God, that You’ll let the fruits, his works that follow him, be great, continuing on with his children, his wife. We pray that You’ll bless her, Lord. You said You would be a husband to “the widows that were widows indeed.” I pray for our Sister Palmer and for all the children. I know how to sympathize with both, losing a companion and also losing my dad. So, Father, while we’re here, tonight, we pray that You’ll prepare our hearts, also, for that hour. We don’t know. It might come as sudden as his did. We don’t know when it will come, but we know it’s got to come. So we pray, God, that You’ll search every heart that’s in here, tonight. God, don’t leave mine out. Search mine, too, and try me. Lord, if there be any evil in us, take it out. We want to serve You. That’s our full objective, is to serve You. Pour out Your Spirit upon us, tonight, and the rest of this week. Bless this tabernacle by the name of the Life Tabernacle. May it receive full blessings of that name and be full of the Life of God, this week, to save every lost soul, to fill every believer with the Holy Ghost, and renew the hopes that’s in us, Lord, again. We pray that You’ll also heal all the sick and the afflicted that comes among us. May Your great Holy Spirit be here, Lord, and just heal. And anoint each one to believe. Grant these things, Father. God, help me now. If it fall, has fall my turn to bring the Message. I pray, God, that You’ll just let the man part stand to one side. May the Holy Spirit come in and move upon us, Lord. May the Holy Ghost take the meeting, Lord. We know that we’re so insufficient. We could not do it, none of us. We don’t claim to be able to do it. But, Lord, we know that Thou art the One. So we’re looking to Thee, Lord. Move, Spirit of God, and fall fresh on us. We ask in Jesus’ Name. Amen. Now I want to pass greetings on down the line, to the churches now that’s hooked up across the state. We’re on the telephone hookup, which is a fine little system that we have been able to get, through our Brother Pearry Green from Beaumont, Texas. And the churches, completely, that’s following the Message, all the way across the United States, is hooked up, tonight. We send greetings, up and down the West Coast, all the way from Vancouver down to Tijuana, Mexico, through San Jose, Los Angeles. All the groups over in there, we greet you from Shreveport. Also, all the way to Prescott, Arizona, to the group up there that’s waiting on the Lord, we send greetings to you, and to Tucson, also Sierra Vista. All the way to New York, up and down, across the nation, the Lord bless you, each one. Wish you were here, tonight, this beautiful old state of Louisiana, where it seems like a second home, to me. I … You know, you people up in New York, you know, I kind of laugh at you a little bit, the way you talk. I’m right at home tonight. Yeah. Everybody down here, you know, they said, “Hello, d’ere, Brother Branham. You bring Sister Branham and all the young’ns and come over to see us.” Oh, my! That makes me feel good. That’s real English, to me. Not disregarding you people in the east and the north, and different places. But, you know, I guess I was just born an old Reb’ and have to stay that way. I kind of like it, myself. It’s real English. I was at a Business Men’s breakfast, here not long ago, and they said, “We will now stand and sing the national anthem.” And I stood up, said, “For my old Kentucky home, far away.” Well, to me, that was the national anthem. That’s all I knowed about it. So, we send you greeting. And now to the … I believe they’re going to try to broadcast the breakfast, also, the Business Men’s breakfast, Saturday morning. Brother Green will tell you, as he’s at the microphones out there now. So he’ll tell you what time the breakfast starts, and what time, each night, to tune in. We thank you very kindly. Pray for us. Now, to the local assembly here, and Brother Jack’s tabernacle, I just going to ask you a favor, tonight. Being that I was going to give my thanksgiving Message across the nation, tonight, to our local churches that’s following the Message. In this, I may be a little lengthy. And then, again, I may preach some Doctrine. So, if so, and you don’t agree with It … Just like I always said about eating cherry pie: “When I run into a seed, I don’t throw the pie out, I throw the seed out, just keep on eating pie.” So if I happen to mention something tonight, I … Well, that’s one reason I took this invitation, tonight, to be here, to bring my thanksgiving Message to the groups across the country, was because Brother Jack always so freely open his door and says, “Preach what’s on your heart.” So I feel real at home. So it may be that in here, in the local assembly here with Brother Jack, there might be ministers and some people that would disagree with Doctrine. Usually I have the courtesy not to mention doctrine in a man’s pulpit, that has invited me to come speak for him. So, after tonight, I suppose I’ll just be praying for the sick and doing the regular service. But I thought I would let you know beforehand, that if something that I say that might be disagreeable, why, just allow it to my ignorance, I guess, and know no better. And pray for me. So now let us turn in the Word, to a chapter here. I wish to refer to many places tonight, because I’ve got several Scriptures and little notes wrote out here in a tablet. I remember the first time I climbed on the platform at Life Tabernacle, twenty years ago. I didn’t have to write down my Scriptures and reference. I was just twenty years younger then. But now I’ve done passed twenty-five, so I … the second time. So I’ve … can’t remember it like I used to. I have to write my Scriptures down, and sometimes brief down something another I want to refer to. And now the Lord bless as we read out of God’s Word, and the Book of Romans, the 7th chapter. Now, I want to kind of teach this like a Sunday school lesson. I know there is people standing. And at the tabernacle, usually, at Jeffersonville, we want to greet you all, tonight, too, know that you’re hooked up there at the tabernacle. And looks like being at the tabernacle, tonight, if you were down here, the people around the walls, and overflowed. Now, I suppose you’re that way, too, all the people that’s up in that part of the country, that come in for the Message. Now we are going to use this like a Sunday school lesson. And it’s not directed to anything, any certain persons, or anything; just to the Church, the Body of Christ that we’re trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives, believing that the Coming of the Lord Jesus is at hand. We believe that. Much more, it’s twenty years closer than it was the first time I come to Shreveport. Oh, so much has happened since that time! Now we’re looking forward for the Coming of the Lord, in our generation. I’m not looking for revival in our generation. I’m looking for the Coming of the Lord, in our generation. Now in Romans 7. Trusting that you have your Bibles open, everywhere now, across the country. We want to read closely now. This Message out of here, it seems like it’s on marriage and divorce, but it really isn’t. To me, it’s a prophecy for the Church in the last days. Let us read. Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he liveth? For the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she is married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be joined or should be married to another, even to him who is risen from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. For when we were in the flesh, … motions of sin, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. And now let us pray. Dear God, we have just read what we believe to be the sacred Word of God. And that’s what we are believing, that not one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from This until all is fulfilled. And we believe that our Lord told us, in Revelation the 22nd chapter, that, “Whosoever shall take one Word from It or add one word to It, the same, his part, will be taken from the Book of Life.” And we see that, by misrepresentation of this Word, as Satan misrepresented It to Eve, caused her to doubt one Word, threw the whole human race into a fallen chaos. Just one Word! Then we see in the middle of the Book, came our Lord and Saviour, and He gave us this quotation concerning It. “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Then the solemn warning in the last Book, of the Revelation of Jesus Christ, “Whosoever shall add a word or take a Word away, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.” O God, knowing, seeing how fragile we are, knowing that we’re walking on the brittle threads of life, of this mortal life (not knowing what time that we’re going to be summoned to answer on High), let us, O Lord, lay aside everything in our heart, everything in our mind, and look straight to Your Word, tonight, and for You to come and interpret It with living oracles. Grant it. May Your Spirit fall upon us and anoint the Word to our heart, that we might go from here, this evening, better people than we are now, that we might have a closer insight on Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord, that we might understand the day that we’re living in, and the preparation of God for His people in this hour; this great, crucial, dark time that we’re now living in. God, anoint us, not only speaker, but hearer. And, together, make our hearts to tremble at Your Word. “For the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.” Grant these things, Father, for we ask it in Jesus’ Name. Amen. I’d like to title these few remarks that I was going to make here, and some Scriptures that I would like to follow up closely behind, if the Lord willing, to the thanksgiving Message, to the invisible, of, The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ. The Invisible Union Of The Bride Of Christ. It doesn’t sound like a thanksgiving Message. Though, any Scripture, we’re thankful for all of It. I am thankful to God, to be living in this time, of the closing scenes of this world’s history. I don’t know. If I would have had a say-so before the foundation of the world, and if God would have laid out the whole program to me, and said to me, “I want you to preach. And now what age do you desire, to go to the earth to preach?” I would have chose this age, for I think this is the golden age. I certainly would have loved to have been here during the time of His visit to the earth. But, still, I think this right now is a greater time, because it’s a time that He’s coming to take the people that He’s redeemed, nearing the resurrection when all the redeemed will come forth. What a glorious opportunity we have, to speak to a dying people, great time! We are enthused about it. And we know that history is closing out. The world’s history will soon be over, then we’re going to step into a new day, to the great Millennium. That, as one believer, I believe in the … in a Millennium, a Millennium reign with Christ, a thousand years upon the earth; the physical return of the Lord Jesus, to take a physical people, glorified, by His cleansing Blood. Paul here is giving an illustration, in our Scripture, about the law and grace, and illustrating it like marriage and divorce. This passage is very seldom preached on, because it’s, more or less, pertains to, like, marriage and divorce. But it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce, of how that he’s trying to set in order here that we, as a Church, can no more be married to the world and to Christ, at the same time, and be legal and lawful about it, than it can be for a woman to be living with a husband while she’s got a living husband. And I have my own thoughts of that, and I believe that what the Bible says is the Truth. Now, but I believe, also, is to my belief, that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of prophecy. And I hope that the Lord will help us, tonight, as we deliver this to our waiting people across the country. It was said, one time (I was reading, when I was writing the note for this, I could not exactly remember the book that it’s in, but I’m sure this is right), that (one of the books I read on Mr. Moody, Dwight Moody, in Chicago; we have a great listening church in Chicago, also, tonight), that, Mr. Moody, after reading Romans 7, ran into the street, and the first man he met, he said to him, “Do you know grace?” And the man replied, “Grace who?” Mr. Moody said, “The grace of God.” So, it so thrilled him when he seen what, how grace had separated us from the law, and how, that what part grace played. Well, now, anything that I want to do, is when … I always told the people, when I cross the line, on the other Side, I’d like to stand up and sing. Amazing grace! How sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me! Grace, precious grace! More of grace to know! “For it’s by grace we are saved; not by what we can do.” What we can, whatever we do, is not counted to us. Grace is what saves us. “By grace are you saved, through faith.” May I add to this Woman, Grace, may I place Her in the Bible, also, as called the elect Lady, this Miss Grace I’m going to talk about. You know, the Bible declares, said, “To the elect Lady.” That, if you notice, “elect” come from the word “elected Lady.” One Lady, amongst all the other ladies, was elected. Like, the virgin was to bring forth the body of God, on the earth. She was an elected woman. God chose Mary. And, also, God has chose an elected Lady, which is His Bride. She’s elected. I hope we’re members of that, tonight, across the world, across the nation, rather. The illustration here, showing the relationship of Bride to Christ, the elect Lady: and how She was to be brought to Him; where She would come from; and how that She would be brought to Him. The Church here, in illustration that we got in view, is illustrated by a woman. Which, a woman is always a type of the Church, because the Church is considered a Bride. A Bride, She is the Bride of the Lord Jesus, the Son of God. Always, if you’ll watch, watch the conditions and the conduct of women, and you’ll see where the church is. Now, this, some of these remarks may seem strange to some of you, but it’s complementary to the Message that I have from the Lord, that I’m trying to get to the peoples. See? You watch everything in the natural, how it’s happening, nature, and watch it. It runs sure with the spiritual, also. Now, if you’ll see the conduct of women in the world today, watch the conduct of the worldly church today. Just watch. Of course, now, there is also the conduct of the spiritual Bride, the Church. See? Watch That, also. [Blank spot on tape] Because, the natural so call, claim to be Bride. Now, please let me say again to the local assembly. Don’t feel bad now. I’m speaking to all out across the country, to the, what I think, the elect Lady. So if there happen to be ministers in here, that doesn’t agree, well, just hold your peace for a little while. See? Notice. Just listen. Notice this character. When you see women just go on the rampage, just doing anything they want to do, watch, the church is doing the same thing. Notice. But watch when, the spiritual Bride, when She begins to have a revival, when She begins to come back and line Herself up with the Word of God. Watch then again, you see, how that the Scriptures, at that time, there’ll be a Message sweep out to catch that Bride, catch that Woman, Elect. For, as the world, Satan, the deceiver who deceived the first bride, to sinning against God, by misbelieving His Word … And now, today, as we see the church natural, in your intellectual gospel, going further and further away from the Word, in social gospel; we find that the women of the world, on the streets, members of such, is carrying themselves in the same atmosphere. You can’t tell them. They’ve lost all sense of common decency, the people have. See? And that’s the way the church has. And you can see it going straight to the ecumenical council, just as certain as anything in the world, and right into Rome as hard as it can go, see, ’cause it’s prophesied. And there she is. That’s her behavior. But then watch again to the spiritual Church, how that group of people, called out, the Elected, through every revival. In Martin Luther, it happened the same way in the reformation. It happened the same thing in the time of John Wesley. It happened the same thing when Pentecostal first started. They dropped them women right back in line with the Word, and then they drift away. There she goes right back over into chaos. But then the time that the people are ready to line up, there is a Message comes forth, and they line with It. Luther was the messenger of one day, of justification, and the Church lined right with it, some of them. The rest of them continued on. Wesley come with sanctification, the Church lined right with it. Pentecost come with the restoration of the gifts, the Church lined right with it, the Elect of that day; and then faded away, went right back off in denominationalism and went right out with the rest of them, all of them right down along the line. Now, but you notice, when the people begin to try to line with the Word, there comes a fresh Message from the Word of God, right straight to the people. And they catch that Message and line up, every time. It’s just in God’s … We have that. We have families. Every family in here is custom to that. Sometimes everything will run fine for you, for years. Then, all at once, you’ll hit a spell where, we say it many times in the South here, “When it rains, it pours,” and everything goes wrong. You’re going through a nighttime. Then there’s a daybreak, then a nighttime. Everything runs in continuity. The prophet, Paul, here is saying that a woman cannot remarry until her first husband is dead. She cannot remarry as long as her first husband is living; she, by no circumstances, at all. She must remain single as long as her first husband is living. And if she should do such a sin, “she shall be called an adulteress.” I’m speaking of the natural now, to type it with the spiritual. If this woman would commit such a sin, then she is marked, “an adulteress,” if she has two living husbands at the same time. Therefore, she has forfeited, by doing this, her rights to God and Heaven, by doing so. She sure has. She is an outcast from the economy of God, according to the Scriptures that I’ve just read. So is the church, when she tries to mix creed and denomination with the Word of God. She can’t be married to a denomination, and be the Bride of Christ, at the same time. She’s got to be dead to one or the other. The law says so, here. There’s plenty of laws in God’s Word. And that’s His law, Paul speaking the same thing here. She cannot be married to a church of worldly creed, and be the Bride of Christ, because (she) one is contrary to the other. Now, remember. Say, “Well, we believe this, but we don’t believe That.” If you’re married to Christ, Christ is the Word of God. In Saint John, the 1st chapter, said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the same was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Christ was the living Word. He always was the Word. He is still the Word. He always will be the Word. He was only the manifestation of the attributes of God, for He was the Son of God. And any son is the attributes of his father, and just as you were in the genes of your father, in the body of your father when he was a young boy, you were in him. Yet, he could not have fellowship with you, because he didn’t know you. But then, through the bedding grounds of a mother, you were brought forth into the earth and become in the image of your father, then he could fellowship with you. And so were you, sons of God and daughters of God, before there even was a moon, stars, or a molecule. You were sons and daughters of God, for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning. For, there’s only one form of Eternal Life, and that was you, before. You don’t know nothing about it. Neither did you know when you was in your earthly father, but you are manifested to … in his image. In the image of God you are made, and you were manifested for the glory and the fellowship of God. And, therefore, as sure as your gene had to be in your father, before your natural birth, your spiritual gene had to be in God, because you’re an expression of the attributes of His thoughts, before the foundation of the world. Right. No way around it. That’s right. Now, now we notice, then, that Life being in you, God’s Life being in you, from the foundation of the world. Now, now, you cannot mix denomination creed with the Word, because they’re too contrary, one to the other. That’s exactly what Satan tried to do with his intellectual conception to Eve. He said … he admitted that God said it, but he said, “Surely, you’ll not die.” See? And they believe that. And that’s what creed has done, tonight. Denomination has separated the people from the Word of God. Didn’t Jesus say, when He come, “You, through your tradition, have made the Commandments of God of no effect to the people”? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] And through our creed, we have disassociated the fellowship of the Holy Spirit to anoint the Word of God that’s laced out for this generation. We have separated the people so, by denomination, that they cannot have a chance to see It. Now, God, He, every generation, He adds a new part of His Book. It all goes together. Like my body was built. I’m told it started in the spine, but wasn’t all spine. It went from that to ribs, and from lungs, and to hands, and arms, and feet, and so forth, and it come on out to be the person that I am. And so was God manifested in the beginning. And finally He was appeared as Jehovah, God the Father. Then He appeared as God the Son, in Jesus Christ. Now He’s appeared as God the Holy Ghost. The same God, all the time, three manifestations of the same God. Now, we find in this, that, each generation, God has lotted His Word from the beginning. Just like evolution came. Just like first thing God created, probably, was … Let’s say He created botany life, first. Then He created animal life, next. Then He created human life, next. Kind of an evolution, rising higher. So has it been in God and His Church. Justification under Luther. Sanct- … That’s pulling His Bride out, now. He’s creating His Bride. Justification under Luther; sanctification under Wesley; and so forth, you see. He, the evolution of the Spirit being given more and more, ’cause the Body is building, coming to the Head, which is Christ, the Body of Christ. Now, She, as a woman, if She is married to Christ the Word, She cannot be married to a church denomination at the same time, for She’s bound by it. She shall … cannot live with both husbands at the same time. They’re contrary, one to the other. One is God-sent, the other one is man-made, so they’re contrary. Said, “Let every man’s word be a lie; Mine be the Truth.” God said that. Just as much contrary to one another, as law was to grace, as Paul speaking of here. One must be dead, to have the other. “And if she tries to mix them, she shall be called an adulteress.” Oh! Think of it. New York, Arizona, across the nation, think of it. God said, “If she’s tried to be married to two at the same time, she shall be called an adulteress.” What adulteress can enter Heaven? Would God marry an adulteress? Certainly not. He asked us not to do it. “She shall be called an adulteress.” Then, her children, if she is an adulteress, her children is illegitimate. Illegitimate! Illegitimate to what? Not to the church, but to the Word. She is illegitimate. What a picture of this Revelation 3 here, of the last-day Laodicea church age! What an illegitimate group! What a denominational mix up! Lukewarm, carry on and call themselves Christians, and deny the Word of God, “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof,” as the prophet said they would be. Marriage is the oldest institution in the world. Marriage was performed first, and instituted, in the garden of Eden. A woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile. A woman is trusted to that. There’s not a creature on earth like a woman. There’s no female dog, there’s no female of any kind, entrusted with the character that a woman is. A woman was not even in the beginning of the creation, because God knowed that she would fall. All other females could not commit adultery. She is the only one that can commit adultery. If she had been made like the original, that would been discomplimentary to God’s great wisdom. See? She was made a by-product of a man. But because she was cast over in that side, she has also been given a sacred charge from God, for redemption. She’s got characters that she must not defile. If she would mar them, she is defiled for lifetime. No matter how much she is forgiven, she can’t be justified. I’ll strike that in a little bit. Got a Scripture on that, in a few minutes. She can be forgiven for her defilement, but she cannot be justified in this life. It’s always with her. Notice now. She’s been given this. She may be forgiven, but not justified. Her body is given to her, a sacred trust from God. No female dog, no bird, no other animal, no other creature like that. No. She is the only one. By it, she is … The reason it’s so sacred, she is to bring forth life into the earth. Her body is the bedding grounds of life, therefore that’s the reason she is give this sacred trust. Now here is where you may disagree, many, you theologians. That’s what defiled the whole human race, is that adultery at the beginning. Her bedding ground was marred. She brought forth those twins, Cain and Abel. One act, two children. Search the Scriptures. Uh-huh. Notice now. We find that her body is the bedding grounds, and therefore it’s a sacred trust, not to defile that. Now, I’m speaking now, bringing this to an illustration, to show you where the Church stands. I’m not speaking of you women. Whatever you are, that’s between you and God, or you men. But I’m speaking of the Church and Christ. Now, this she is given, to bring forth life that only God Himself can give. Her husband might be the germ bearer, but God has to produce the life. That’s right. It has to come. All life has to come from God. Any life has to come from God. It’s perverted, and that’s what makes it sinful, but life has to come from God. He’s the Author of life. Now she has a sac- … one … I want to name three things here that she must not get away from. Now, I’m speaking, keep the church in mind while I’m speaking this to the natural woman, as Paul is here, in 7th chapter of Romans. She has a sacred trust of virtue committed to her by her Lord, a certain virtue. Nothing else holds it but a woman. Right. That’s committed to her by God. She must not defile that virtue. If she even does something wrong, she must confess that to her husband before he takes her, and make it right. The same as the church that was married to the law, has to come also before Christ, before the second marriage. She has to confess that. If she doesn’t, and she lives with her husband for ten years and then confess it, he has a right to put her away and marry another woman. That’s the Scripture. Fornication is unclean living. “Joseph, fear not, take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.” He was minded to put her away privately, see, after he’d already engaged to her. When you’re engaged to her, as far as God is concerned, you’re married to her. Notice now. She has a sacred trust of virtue that’s been given her, trusted to her by the Lord. God gave her that virtue. Just as it was in the garden of Eden, she can say “yes” or “no.” She has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her, that she must not break. The womanhood I’m speaking of here is her conduct, her character around men. Not letting every man … Looks on these screens and see these movie stars kissing, and hugging, and slopping, and around, over these women. A woman does that, is of a bad character. She might be virtuous, otherwise. But, see, in her heart … When, those glands, sex glands, are in the lips. The man kisses a woman, he’s actually, potentially, committed adultery. Sex glands are in the woman’s lips and in the man’s lips. He could kiss her on the hand, it wouldn’t mix through their sex glands. But the sex glands is in the lips. And see all this nonsense in the Hollywood today, of all this slopping and loving around with women, and so forth, and little girls looking at all that. No wonder our morals are rotten and decayed, and filthy, see, because it’s put before the children. That’s right. It has to be that way for the last day. Now keep the church in mind. She is kissing and slopping, and mixing around in everything else but the Word, let the devil, and education and scientific searches, and so forth. When, scientific, education, everything, is absolutely contrary to God. The whole system of civilization that we have now is absolutely antichrist. Educational system is antichrist. Civilization is antichrist. It’s against God. You say, “Against civilization?” God will have a civilization, one of these days, that won’t have any death associated into it. This modern civilization come by Satan. I’ll prove that to you, if the Lord willing, tonight, out of the Bible. All these things are of Satan. Our new civilization will have none of this in it. She has this sacred womanhood. No wonder that men act around women the way they do, is because women act around men the way they do. She characters herself out here with a pair of shorts on, and skin-tight, and men’s clothing and things, out on the street, twisting around. No matter what she says, she might be as virtuous to her husband as she can be, but, in the sight of God, “She is an adulteress.” “Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.” And she presented herself to be that. And that’s exactly what the church has done with the world. Notice. That’s committed to her: sacred virtue, sacred womanhood, and then sacred motherhood, honor her husband. Just look today. In certain cities, many cities, they even have big parties in what call society, church members, too. Set their hats in the floor, and they all get drunk and pitch their keys into it. Each woman goes and picks a key out of the hat, for the man she’ll live with over the weekend. All kinds of such parties! Which, I’ve got so much to say here, if the Lord willing, I haven’t got time to go into it. Such a filth! And the church is just as bad, right, committing adultery with everything, and she has no business to be going into. She should stay with the Word. Buildings are all right. Hospitals are all right. All these other things are all right. Educational programs, that’s all right. We have to live here, have to read, write. That’s one of the economies. Like, we wasn’t supposed to put on any clothes, at the beginning. I’ll preach on that, later this week, the Lord willing. But we have to wear clothes because God gave us clothes. But, in the beginning, we didn’t need them. We were veiled. Now she is veiled to her sin. She don’t even know she is sinning, see, as she was then. By the … Now she is veiled by the devil; then she was veiled by God. The difference of it. Now we find out that she has been given this sacred trust that she must not break: of womanhood, act, have her character, raise her children, be honorable to her husband. Now days, they pay a bit more attention to it than nothing in the world. You ought to set in my office sometime and see men bring in their wives, where they try to get right with God and confess of all the men they lived with, and everything else, since they been married. Oh, you say, “That’s … ” No. That’s Pentecostals. Uh-huh. The others won’t come. So it’s … I’m speaking of how it can get away, when you get to mixing up with the world, the church, and all the fashions and things that we have. We’re no more like the original Pentecost was than day is from night. We’ve drifted off somewhere, into some dark chaos somewhere, and lost. What a sacred trust! What a responsibility to a woman! Now see why she’s a type of the Church, which has the same responsibility. As a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood, to her virtues, to her husband, the Church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the Word, and to Christ, just the same as the woman has. And as a woman drifts off with another man; when the church goes off on these institutional programs, and building programs and schools, and so forth. I have nothing against them. They’re all right. They serve their purpose. But they’re not … Jesus never said, “Go, make schools.” He said, “Preach the Word.” That’s where they neglect It. Not make institutions, hospitals, and so forth. Them is all right, but that’s not the Church’s duty. Their duty is to preach the Gospel, but we’ve done everything else but that. And we’ve drifted in, just like Satan did, and mix it up with some Gospel, something else, and something else, till it’s got a conglomeration of nothing. Corruption, even our whole, the whole world! Watch the trend of the world. Reading Reader’s Digest, here not long ago, where young girls are going through the menopause, and men, the change of life, between twenty and twenty-five years old. They’re going through their middle age. Corruption, (why?) because of scientific research of food and stuff that’s broke down, from the natural things we should put in our body. We are nothing but a bunch of dying corruption. Now, that’s what the church is, also. It’s in the same condition. She’s a type. She has the same precious virtues by Spirit, given to Her, to preserve the Spirit and the Word, and never commit adultery with anything of the world or anything. Stay virgin to the Word, as a woman is to stay virtuous to her husband. It’s a sacred trust, to honor Her Lord’s Word above every man-made creed, wisdom, denomination there is. The Church is given that trust. If they say, “Well, my church … ” I don’t care what your church believes. If it’s contrary to the Word of God, stay away from it. The Bible said, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.” Mark 16 said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” If a church preaches different from That, don’t you. You die to that thing. Be borned again, into the Word of God. “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.” That’s how far It was to go. “These signs shall follow them that believe, in all the world, and every creature that will believe.” See how we got away from It? Sure. But She is responsible for It. But now look what, Hollywood, has took the virtuous things from our women. I’m setting here looking at dear old woman, Sister Schrader, many of the women here, and back, and Sister Moore over here, the older women that remembers a few years ago. If their mother, or even them, would have walked out on the streets, the way some of these women walk today, church members, they’d have locked the woman up for being insane. “She forgot to put on her skirt.” Well, if it was insane then, it’s insane now. Well, look, the whole world proves it’s insane. Look at the murders and things that’s going on now in the world. See? Insanity! The whole thing is coming to fulfill Revelations. We may get to it, this week. Where, those hideous things, them is not natural. That’s spiritual things, that make people scream for the rocks and the mountains, and everything else, to fall on them. The complete, total insanity this world will go into, right away, it’s almost there now. Why, you see the footsteps of it. There it is. It’s marching right out on the street, right down the church pew, total insanity, do things that a human being wouldn’t think of doing and being civilized. Look what Hollywood has done to the woman. Look how it is. It’s robbed the sacred virtues of the woman. On and on, we could go. See? All this she lost. How did she do it? Because there was a subtle instrument called the church, like there was in the garden of Eden. A subtle person, the devil, walked into the church just like he did in the garden of Eden, and deceived her into it. She is deceived. The woman thinks; she don’t mean to be wrong. Eve didn’t mean to do wrong. It wasn’t willfully. But she … The Bible said, in Second Timothy, First Timothy 3, “She was deceived.” And deceived is not when you willfully do it. It’s when you’re deceived into doing it. And that’s just exactly what’s happened today. She’s been deceived, by television, by magazine, by these people, these, all these fine things that they’re going, out on the street. Modern girls, they look at magazines and they look at pictures. They look on the street. They see the clothing in the shops. How Satan, that great instrument of hell, has come down amongst the people and deceived them into these things! And the woman thinks she is all right. And she is dead and don’t know it. She is far from God. See how she lost all this, and how subtle it was? Today, I want you to notice. Jesus spoke of it. Also, if you’d like to read it, Jesus made mention that this thing would come to pass (Did you know that?) in His last hours, just before His crucifixion. Let’s just read it, Saint Luke, the 23rd chapter, and just for a moment, like a Sunday school lesson. Begin with the 27th verse, I believe I got marked out here. Jesus going to Calvary. Listen as I read it. All right. Saint Luke 23:27, I believe, is where we have it. My note has got it that way. Yeah. Here it is. And there followed him a great company of people, and … women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, … that they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Think, today, a disgrace for her to have a child. See? Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and hi- … and the hills, Cover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall they do in a dry? Speaking of the day that when women wouldn’t no more want children. They want a dog or a cat, or something like that, but she don’t want children anymore. Why? She is “Old Mother Hubbard” if she has a child. See? She don’t want. That’s the remarks of Hollywood. It don’t want his woman to be an “Old Mother Hubbard.” So she’ll, he’ll have some operation performed to himself or her, one, that’ll keep them from having children. They don’t want no children. Jesus spoke of it. And what did He say? “At that time they’ll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to ‘Fall on us.’” She’ll practice birth control, so she can go to parties. She can’t be bothered with a baby nursing her. “It’ll disform her. When she’s pregnated, it’ll be, it disform her. She won’t look like she used to.” And her husband, ignorant enough to let her go that way. She won’t give him a child. Jesus spoke of it. And He said, that, “When they were doing this, at that time they’ll go to crying then for the rocks to fall on them.” It’s Coming of the Lord. They pay great sums of money for cats, dogs, to mother. That’s right. She must mother something, because it’s a God-given nature to her. I notice. I hunt big game. An old bear in the fall of the year, when she has been bred to the male bear, she’s got cubs then that’s born. They’re pretty good-size cubs, maybe weigh a hundred pounds or better. She’ll make them scat and hibernate to themselves, because she’s going to bring forth some more cub. They’re born in February. The bear knows nothing about it. They’re born in little sacs. How that God has them open these little sacs, themself, little … like little cellophane sac. They find their way around. Their mother is sound asleep. She hasn’t eat anything since October, and this is February. They come around and nurse her till the middle of May. Then when she sees her cubs, they’re pretty good-size cubs, weigh maybe fifteen, ten or fifteen pounds apiece. They’ve nursed her. How she gets the milk, that’s God’s idea. She lives, herself, and produces milk for the cubs. And then if her breeding doesn’t take, and she don’t have any cubs, she’ll hunt up them year … last-year cubs, and mother them all summer long, because it’s God-given instinct. She has to mother something. And if a woman won’t have a baby for her husband, she’ll take a dog or a cat, or something. She’s got to mother something. It’s a nature. But to bear a child for her husband, and raise it to the service of God, that’s entirely all out of her line. She should. Oh, she’d … Oh, she’d be so disgraced, if she did, by her sin-loving society of this 1965 type of women. A true picture of the modern church today! Neither does the modern church want any of these here, screaming, shouting, tongues-speaking, Acts 2:38 young’ns around her. Yeah. Yeah. See? Yeah. She don’t want any of them whooping, and crying, and screaming, “Amen! Hallelujah!” Why, such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination. They had one like that in one of the churches, why, they’d throw her out right quick. “Why you letting such stuff as this go along?” So, you see, she’s pregnated with something, ’cause she’s bringing forth members all the time. But she don’t want none of them screaming, hollering, blabbering, Acts 2:38, miserable creatures that she thinks they are. It would certainly embarrass her. It would ruin her and her educated, ethical, scientific society church that she belonged to here. They would throw her out, at the next council. She can’t have it. So she don’t want to be pregnated with the Word, because that’s the only kind that the Word can bring forth. Born of the Spirit of God, it has the Spirit of God in it. No intellectual church-join and creed-going, bobbed hair, painted face; there’s no such a thing as that in all of It. You don’t find that in the Word of God. You find an old-fashion, sanctified, Holy Ghost-filled child, born of the Spirit of God, screaming, hollering, shouting, praising God. That’s altogether out of the reaches for her. She don’t want That. Oh, no, sir! No, indeedy. What does she do then? So she brings forth a pair, a painted-face, short-wearing, Jezebel society, illegitimate “cats,” they call them, I think it is. See? I think they call it cats. See? “Look at that cat going there,” they say, or something like that, you know. She was born, or married, connected with her first husband, the first Adam, by the adulterous wife, Eve, Adam’s first wife. You say, “Adulterous?” She sure was. But, oh, she claims that this Adam, this first Adam, is dead. “Oh, sure, he died a long time ago. I’m reborn, again,” she said, “and I’m certainly married to the Second Adam, Christ, the Word.” How? Notice what she loves. Watch her lover, you want to see who she is in love with. The Word says This, but she said, “My church says this.” Then who she in love with? Who is her husband? Her own fruits prove what she is. Exactly right, shows what she is. Notice. She was born, first, to Adam, ’cause that’s her natural birth. See? And she never left that. That’s a lover of the world. She claims that she is born the second time, to Christ. But her lover, notice, is Adam, yet, because she loves the world. And another thing, notice what kind of children she is bearing. That tells what their papa is, whether it’s the first Adam or Second Adam. If the Church brings forth a child of the Second Adam, he acts the Second Adam’s way of acting, like they did on Day of Pentecost. That’s the really true Second Adam’s children. See? Right. Their nature is like his and hers. Yes, sir. Her daughters, painted-face, bobbed-haired, wearing men’s clothes, trousers. The Bible said for her “not to do it.” She cuts her hair. “It’s a shame to her.” You say, “Shut up, on that.” That’s what the Word says. I’m only pointing out nature. That’s what she does. Her sons, her sons born out of her, rely upon education, schooling, some Bible school, so-called, some great college that’s supposed to be a long time ago, hatching them out, in some sort of an incubator style. Denominational-seekers, religious Cain-like, just illegitimate to the Word as Cain was; right, just as illegitimate as Cain was, sure, denominational-seekers. You see what it is? God never did organize a denomination. He’s always been against it. His Word is against it. But they hold right onto it, so you see what they’re bringing forth. That shows who their papa and mama is. Exactly. Exactly. Just as illegitimate as Cain was. That’s kind of a child he brought forth from Eve. They got away from the Word, then see what she brought. That’s just exactly what the church has brought, the same thing. Can prove it to you, by the Word, that that’s where education and civilization come, through Cain. That’s exactly right. For they claim … But they claim to be sons of God, but they’re denominational-bred, denominational school-scholared, everything else. That’s exactly right. Subtle, smart! My! So was the serpent, their father. Right. Just as subtle and scientific preachers as Cain was. See? It’s exactly the same thing. You say, “Brother Branham, is that true?” Turn to Genesis 4:16 and find out. Get back here in Genesis 4:16, just a minute, you’ll find out how it happened. And Cain went … from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after … his son, Enoch. On down to Tubal, on down, for they begin, come designers of instruments, music, and so forth. Civilization came by Cain, right, building cities, instruments. Scientific men come by Cain, the serpent’s seed. Now notice the 25th verse. And Adam knew his wife again; Now, he knew her once and she had two children. Search the Scripture. She had Cain and Abel. One act, and two children. You say … They told me, not long ago, it couldn’t be, happen. We got a case in Hollywood. Hollywood? We got a case in Tucson right now, up in court. A woman gave birth to a colored child and a white child, at the same time. They say she can’t do it. She can have two fertile seeds, too. They got it right in court now. I know dogs will do it. Animals will do it. And she’s got there, the white man said, “I’ll support my own child, but not him.” And the woman made the confession. She lived with her husband that morning, and the colored man that afternoon. “If it’s in,” the doctor says, “in the space of twenty-four hours, it’ll happen if there’s another fertile seed there.” And there she did it. And that’s exactly what happened here. Cain that … Satan, that morning, in the serpent; and Adam, that afternoon. When she … And she had two children. Now, Adam knew his wife again (the second time); and she bare a son, … Remember, there is nowhere in the Bible that said Cain was Adam’s son. Said, “He was of that evil one,” not Adam, “the devil.”  … knew his (the second time), and knew … and had a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed … (That wasn’t the real Seed.) … appointed me another seed instead of Adam, whom Cain slew. So … And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: and then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. Not out of Cain’s, that generation genealogy, but out of Seth’s genealogy. So, “Cain is the evil one.” There come the serpent. Now notice. The Bible plainly says here, that, “Her first husband must be dead,” not just put away. He’s got to be dead. I just got through preaching on Marriage And Divorce, and you all know about that. I’m not speaking now, altogether, this congregation here, but out across the nation. All right. Now you see what happened there, in Marriage And Divorce. When it …?… The Seven Seals was opened, that brought out the real Truth of it. So, to be married to the Second Adam, Christ, the Word, you must separate yourself by death, from your first denominational husband, ’cause there isn’t a one of them that can take all the Word of God. Just show me where that one is at. “Oh,” you say, “mine.” The other fellow says his, too. Put them together, and you find out you’re both wrong, soon as you denominate. Read Revelation 17. So, you see, you’ve got to be dead from that thing. Now, I’m not speaking to this local assembly. I’m speaking altogether across the nation. You must be dead to your first husband. If you’re united to Christ and still married to a denomination, you’re an adulteress. You are Laodicea. A Church across the nation, we’re following Jesus Christ, the Word. To be in the Bride, you have to be remarried to the Word of God, which is Christ. “In the beginning was the Word; the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us.” As long as you hold to man’s tradition of denominations, you are called, in God’s Word, “a adulteress.” As long as you’re a denominational creed-seeker, belonging to a denominational church that denies the Word, you are “an adulteress,” what the Bible said. Jesus said, “You cannot serve two gods at the same time. You either serve God or mammon.” Mammon is “the world.” “He that loves the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in him.” The Seed of God can’t be in him the same time (the love of God) the love of the world is in there. When the Seed of God is operating through you, that’s the Word of God. The love of the world can’t be in there at the same time. Now where is the short hair, and the shorts, and the painted faces? Now where is it at? You can’t be virtuous to Christ, the Word of God, and serve a man-made denomination at the same time. It’s contrary to the Word. Paul said here. “Whereabouts?” Romans 7. Neither can you bear God’s sons, of His Word, to this illegitimate denominational group. You cannot do it. In your incubator, you cannot bring forth a Word son of God. I’m speaking to the church. But still you claim to be very religious. So was Cain, the prostitute Eve’s son, very religious, built altars and offered sacrifice, and paid his tithes and done everything that any other religious man would do. But he failed to keep that Word. He failed to have the revelation. And the revelation is the only thing, the revelation of the Word. What is the … What is a revelation? Jesus said, “Upon this rock I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell can’t prevail against It.” Faith is a revelation; because Faith has been revealed to you. “Abel, by Faith, offered by revelation (Faith), offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain.” Cain thought they eat apples. They still got that idea, but it wasn’t. It was an adultery, serpent’s seed. And there when the Seven Seals opened, it declared it and proved it. My book is just out on it. I think we got a thousand here now. See? Notice. That’s Scripturally, from Genesis to Revelation. At the end time, both trees are coming to the seed and proving themselves. Here we are, right today, Laodicea and the Bride, just as clear and pretty as it can be in the Scripture, and right before your faces. “You can’t serve God and mammon.” You can’t be a virtuous Bible-believing Christian and associate yourself in the denominational affair. You just can’t do it at the same time. One has got to be dead, and let the other one live. Neither can you bear God’s Word son. Neither can the church bring forth. They don’t want one of them, a screaming children, shouting and speaking in tongues, and all them things. They, you can’t do that in a denominational church. They won’t have you. They don’t bring them like that. They take them up and shake their hands and say, “If you believe, you’ve got It. As long as you put your name on the book, that’s all you have to do.” See? It’s illegitimate children to the Word, still claim to be religious. So, pregnated with Satan’s wisdom and knowledge, the church has become! They send their people away to school, to learn how to say “amen” just right. They learn them how to say all this, and be very intellectual. What is it? It’s pregnation of the devil. What did Satan pregnate Eve with? To disbelieve the Word, for intellectuals, intellects, and it ruined the whole creation. That’s exactly what she’s done in the Word today, the church. She’s pregnated herself with Bible schools and colleges, and things like that, reading, writing, arithmetic, and they know no more about God than a Hottentot would know about an Egyptian night. They know all their creeds, their prayer books, and everything else, but know nothing about God. They know when the Word is vindicated, when God spoke back there and lotted out His Word to each generation as they come along. Here come Noah along, and he preached that generation. Now, what if Moses would have come along, said, “Let’s build an ark”? He’d been all out of style. But he was a prophet. He had the revelation of God. God vindicated it to be the Truth. He brought the children about, Israel out, and showed the Pillar of Fire before them, and vindicated the prophet; and said just exactly what He would do, and He did it. They said, “Let not God speak. Let Moses speak, lest we die.” He said, “I’ll speak to them no more like that, but I’ll raise them up prophets, and they’ll speak.” There stood Isaiah standing there, said, “A virgin shall conceive.” A man like him in a day when … How is a virgin going to conceive? “Unto us a Son is born: a Child is born, a Son is given. His Name shall be called: Counsellor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God, the Everlasting Father. Upon the throne of His father, David, He’ll reign. There’ll be no end to His Kingdom.” How is it going be? He didn’t know. He just spoke what God said. It’s beyond any imagination, intellectual. It’s beyond any scientific research. It’s the Word of God. Now we school our seminary students in all kinds of Bible theology and things like that, man-made theology, it’s got a bunch of church just exactly a Laodicea, like God said it would be. Oh, my! When I look at that, and makes me shiver. Pregnated with intellectual conceptions! You’ve got to be a high school graduate before you can even enter. You’ve got to have … got to stand before a psychiatrist before you can be ordained. Would you imagine Peter, James, and John going before a psychiatrist? Remember that hundred and twenty up there, couldn’t even sign their own name? Stand before a psychiatrist, see if they … if all of their … if their reflex was just right, and so forth? They had a reflex, but it wasn’t the intellectual conception or scientific research. It was through the Power of God. When It struck them, they knowed nothing to do but act out what the Holy Ghost said do. They didn’t pay any attention to any intellectual, what the church said, and what the priests said, what this said, that said. They moved by the Spirit; fearless men. First John 2:15, He said, “If you love the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you.” See? So how can you be pregnated with the Word of God which condemns the world, condemns Hollywood, condemns all of its fashion, condemns all these parties and carrying on, and so-called that they have in the name of religion? It condemns it. How can the Word pregnate a person: how can a bobbed-haired woman, painted face, wearing shorts? How can a preacher, goes out here to a seminary, and looks at Acts 2:38 and sees that there’s not a person in the Bible ever baptized in those titles, and then still say he’s pregnated with the Word of God? He’s telling you a lie! He sold his birthrights. He’s committed adultery against the very Thing that he said. He is put away, in divorce. God is going to have a virtuous Church, just exactly, a Bride. Bible said, “The Word is not in you.” So what kind of a children are you bearing? Pregnated denominationals. There has been no death to separate you from your first lover. “What will the Joneses think if I go to crying and speaking in tongue? What will they think if I’m rebaptized?” What a nonsense! Are you married to Joneses? Or, are you married to the church? Or, are you married to Christ, the Word? Now, that’s why she is still bearing his children. What kind of children she have? Here is some of their names they call today: cats, beatles, monsters, rickies, rickettas. Cats, beatles, that’s church members. Sure. They’re all his sons, sons of Cain, which is the sons of the subtle beast, just as smooth as they can be. Now take a good look for a moment, with your own spiritual insight, at your soul. Just look around. I’m speaking ’cross the nation now. Look just a few minutes, you out there in the Branham Tabernacle, you in the tabernacles on the West Coast, and Arizona, and everywhere you’re at. Look at yourself for a few minutes. You say, “That Message you’re preaching, Brother Branham, is wrong.” Look at yourself a little bit. Let the Holy Spirit search your minds with the Word, you’ll agree with the Message. Let Christ, the anointed Word, search out your own conscience. Let Him get into you, see if That’s right or not. And that’s just one or two things I mention, when there hundreds of them. Does the Bible agree with a woman bobbing her hair? [The congregation says, “No.”] Does the Bible believe, agree with three, baptisms in the name of “Father, Son, Holy Ghost”? [“No.”] No such a thing. Does the Bible agree with woman wearing man’s clothing? [“No.”] Well, just take them three there, when there’s hundreds of more. Search it out in the Light of God’s Word. You say, “I’m a church member.” So was Cain. So was Eve. The Bible predicts, in the last days, that the Laodicea will be the same. Let the Holy Spirit search your conscience, and you’ll agree with Daniel 5:12. When the queen come in before Belteshazzar, and said she found out that there was a prophet, Daniel, was among them, and he was a dissolver of doubts. You let the Holy Spirit. He is the Prophet of the day. Let Him come into your heart right now and examine with the Word of God, and the doubts about the Message will be all dissolved. He dissolves all the doubts. You find out, it’s exactly on the Word for this day. You cannot preach Luther’s message today. It goes in It, but that’s the feet. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Cannot preach Wesley. Cannot preach Pentecostal. We’re plumb beyond that. They denominated and died. They’re the stalk. The stalk come up with the blade, that’s the first condition of the church. Now, that there don’t look like the first grain that went in the ground, the wheat. The second come forth is a pollen. That still don’t look like the grain. Looks more like it. It’s coming more in the image of the real grain. But the blades don’t sure look like the grain that went in the ground. It’s a carrier of the life that was in the grain. But what did it do? It denominated, just like all other nature fits in with it. It died. Then what? The life run right up into the tassel. It’s got whole lots of little balls hanging on it, looks like little grains in it. Look like it’s a real grain, but it isn’t. Then it drops down into the shuck. And what does it bring forth? A shuck. Now, you take a grain of wheat, when the wheat is first coming forth. And Jesus said, “A corn of wheat … ” And you take that wheat and open it up. You pull it off the stalk. You look at it. You say, “We got a grain of wheat.” Be careful. It’s just exactly like the grain, but there’s not a bit of grain in it. It’s the shuck. There’s the Pentecostals, “So much,” as Matthew 24:24 said, “deceive the very Elected in the last days, if it was possible.” But you pull leaf by leaf back, you ain’t got no grain. The grain is right back in the back of it. See? And then the Life comes out of that denomination, goes into the grain. Then what happens? When the grain begins to grow, and to get bigger so It can cover over something, the denomination pulls away from It. Why ain’t we got a denomination out of This? They never will be. It’s the grain. It can’t go no farther. We’re at the end time. So what does It have to do now? Lay in the presence of the Son, to be ripened, that’s exact, the Word to be ripened into your heart, to bring forth and live what we’re talking about. Yes, sir. Then you’ll have no more doubts, if you let the Holy Spirit reveal It to you, like the queen said about Daniel. You may say, “What’s this all got to do with thanksgiving? What you talking about, Brother Branham? Here it is, quarter to nine. You didn’t say nothing about thanksgiving.” What a Message for the occasion, to me! Yes, indeed. The pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new-found way of life. Being separated from the old English denominations and creed, they could marry to the new anointed Word for their age; that’s right, the new anointed Word of their age, for their day. So can we be thankful, as pilgrims, like Abraham, separated ourself from the things of the world, all of our associates. Abraham was a pilgrim. God has separated us from all the dead religions. I’m speaking across the nation now, all the dead creeds. And to what? Separated us, and opened to us a new land, a new Message for this day. Pentecost dried up and died, like Luther, Wesley, and the rest of them. It’s no more than a bunch of churches pulled together. Good people in there, yet, has got to be come out. What did He do? He opened up the Seven Seals of the last Message. You notice that? The Seven Seals, which, all the mysteries of the seven church ages was sealed with Seven Seals. The reformers didn’t have time to do it in their days. They didn’t live long enough. But this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals, it’s open to us in this last days, from a prophecy that went forth to Arizona. How I asked God, the other day, “What are You doing with me out here in this desert?” Did you know Moses wrote the New Testament … or the Old Testament? He certainly did. First four Books gives the laws of everything: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. He wrote the Old Testament. To do that, he had to leave all of his associates and loved ones, and go into a desert. Paul wrote the New Testament. That’s right. He wrote Romans, and Romans and all the rest of It there, Hebrews and Timothy, and so forth. And to do that, he had to separate from hisself, and go down into Arabia, into a desert, for three years, get the revelation of God. “Oh,” you say, “how about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John?” They were scribes that just wrote what Jesus did. Paul separated and put the Word together. That’s right. Well, then, look, if it taken that, and had to go to a desert, away from their loved ones … Remember what, What Time Is It, Sir? How many ever heard it? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Was it exactly right? [“Amen.”] Then we’ve got the revelation in this last days, for the Message of the Lord God to gather His Bride together. No other age has it been promised. It’s promised in this age: Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Saint John 14:12, Joel 2:38. Those promises is just exactly like John the Baptist identified himself in the Scripture. Jesus identified Himself. What’d they say? “Away with such a person!” “John is a wild man.” The church wasn’t able to receive it. That’s the pattern. Neither will the church receive it today. But, to the Elected, God is calling to the Elected. They know it: calling the virtuous Bride, the Word, the last-day Church, the elected Lady of our Lord Jesus Christ, Word. If … Jesus is the Word. How many believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] All right. Then, the Bride is always part of the Bridegroom, so the Bride will not be a denomination. It’ll have to be the Word, manifested, to be the Bride of Christ. He promised to do it. He said how He did. Never uses … loses His pattern. He always did it by the pattern. He done it, every time, by the pattern. He does it again, calling out His virtuous Bride in the last day, the lovely Rebekah waiting for Her Isaac. What a beautiful time! Here it brings into view, the two books that’s going to be mysterious to you when you read the book of The Seven Church Ages. The two books: Book of Life, said, one says you can put your name on, you never comes off; other one says you take his name out of the Book of Life. This brings it perfectly in view, right here. I’m going to stop a few minutes, maybe, on a few notes here, and catch this before we close. Life is a sacred thing, to God, and it’s recorded in a book. God is the Author of life. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Our natural life here, we have, is just a perversion. It really should be the right life, to begin with, but it’s perverted by the natural birth. The first life, or your first union, you were joined in at birth, by nature, a natural act. A natural human being associated, man and woman together, associated together in sexual affair, which brought your first life here, and that’s associated with sin and death. How can you miss seeing the serpent’s seed? When you see the woman, a by-product; not another female like her; made in that order, knowing that she could be deceived. God knowed. If He didn’t know the end from the beginning, then He wasn’t God. If He isn’t infinite, if He isn’t … And He can’t be infinite without being omniscient, omnipresent, knowing all things, Eternal. So He knowed all things, and He had to make that woman. The man didn’t have a wife. The wife and the man was the same thing. He had the feminish and masculine spirit in himself. He had to separate, take a by-product, after the whole creation made. No female created by God, in the original creation, can do a thing like that. She was made thus, to do it. He knowed she would do it. If He didn’t, He wasn’t God. But, see, the attributes that’s in God had to be displayed. He was to be a Saviour. And to make everything perfect, the way He had it, then there could be nothing lost. Oh, don’t be children. Be men and women. We’re at the end road. Notice. Now, it was nature, associated with death. Your first husband, that had rule over you, was your nature by natural birth. Natural, you love the world because you are the world, and part of the world. That right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Your desires was, by nature, to love the world which you’re a part of. You’re a part of nature. You believe that? [“Amen.”] And that’s your natural thing. That’s the reason you have to be born again. You have to separate; you have to die to that first husband. You can’t live with it. You just can’t say, “Well, I’ll divorce him, and hang him up here till occasion.” No, sir. No writing of divorcement! He dies. The nature of the world has to die. Every speck of him has to die. You have to be reunited, again, with another Nature. Your name of your first nature, was born, and put in a book of life. And all your deeds was wrote in it, too. Everything you done under that nature was put in a book, called the book of life. You notice, in Daniel, when he come to “the Ancient of Days, Whose hair was as white as wool. Ten thousand times ten thousands came with Him, to minister to Him; the Bride. And then the books were opened.” “And another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life.” See? There is saints already there, the Church, the Bride. “Another Book was opened, which was the Book of Life.” Now, you, but when you were separated from that union, by spiritual death: Your natural desire is to cut your hair. Your natural desire is to wear shorts, paint your face. Your natural desire is to be intellectual, smart man, know something better than the other. That’s what Eve wanted. That’s the very thing she wanted. “Well, say! You little two bit, two-by-four preacher, stand up there and tell me? I’ve got a Ph.D., LL.” That just makes you farther away from God, every time you add one thing. See? See? That’s right. It’s true. See? That’s what Eve took. She was pregnated with that kind of a pregnation. That’s what the church is today, by Bible schools and intellectuals. And, look, every one disagreeing with the other, a big mess just exactly what the Bible said, “Babylon.” The Bride knows where She stands. She is very few. There won’t be many saved; just a very, very, very few. You say, “Well, there, said, ‘thousands.’” Yes. But they’ve come up through the two thousand years, too, on every age where It come out. Ever … Luther’s age and that group; and then died off, and they went, denominated; then Wesley; and then come pentecostals, and so forth. And all the little out branches of Baptists, Presbyterian, Methodists, Nazarenes, Pilgrim Holiness, and so forth, see, all those branched off from there like the leaf. But, you remember, when it went down, and the grain begin to ripen, that you find, before that grain can ripen, everything in that stalk has to be dead. Hallelujah! Can’t you see where we’re standing? Life is in the grain again. What is it? Just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground, the same Jesus in the Bride form, same power, same Church, same thing, same Word. The same Word sucked up through these and come out here, and come to a head here. And all that Life that come through here, picked up its people. Now it’s forming up into a head, for the Rapture. Speaking on that tomorrow night, or next night, one, the Lord willing. Well, you separated from your first union, by spiritual death. Now you are born again, or remarried again, to the new spiritual union; of not your natural life of the things of the world, but of Eternal Life. That germ that was in you at the beginning, found you. Now, your old book is gone, with your old union. Now, your name in your old, in your … has been transferred. Now, you say, “Do you mean to tell me that my old book … ” God put it in the Sea of His Forgetfulness. You stand perfectly before God. Now, your name is now in the new Book; not the book of life, but the Lamb’s Book of Life, what the Lamb redeemed. Not the old book of your natural union, but your new, Bride. Hallelujah! Your new life is in the Lamb’s Book of Life, your marriage certificate, hallelujah, where your true Eternal germ, from the beginning, takes hold. Now you’re not only forgiven, but you’re justified. Glory! “Justified,” Romans 5:1 said. Yeah. Romans 5:1 said, “Therefore being justified by faith.” Look up the word. The word don’t mean forgiven. The word means justified. It don’t mean you’re forgiven. For instance, you heard I got drunk and done some evil things, and everything. Then you come around, say to me. You found out I didn’t do them, then you come around, say, “Brother Branham, I forgive you.” Forgive me? I didn’t do it, at the first place. See? Now, if I did do it, I’m guilty. But you could forgive me, and I wouldn’t be guilty. But yet I’m not justified, because I actually done it. But the word, justified, is though you never done it. Amen. It’s not even regarded, at all. How is it done? In God’s Book of the Sea of Forgetfulness, your old book and marriage is divorced and dead, and it’s not even in the memories of God. Amen. You are justified. “Therefore being justified.” It was accused. You was accused. You never done it, in the first place. The old union is in the Sea of God’s Forgetfulness. You wasn’t married to it, to begin with. He, the Bridegroom, bore your shame, Himself, for you, in your place. He took your place, for you were predestinated for Him, to be in His Bride, before the foundation of the world. The Bible said so. You are the predestinated Seed. How did you come to do this? You were deceived into it by your first marriage, to your adulterous parent, Eve. It’s no fault of your own. By your natural birth, you come after Eve, who committed adultery. That’s the reason you was born an adulteress. You’re a sinner, to begin with. That’s right. You was deceived into it. You had no … No, you, it ain’t your fault. You never did it. Because, that little germ that was in you, was to be you, before the foundation of the world. God put your name in the Lamb’s Book of Life. Like my little eagle story, all of you has heard it. A hen … Old farmer set a hen, one time. So he didn’t have enough hens out … eggs to go under the hen. So then he found an eagle egg, and they put it under him. When the eagle was born, it was the funniest-looking chicken them chickens ever seen, little old eagle going along. And the hen would go, “Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck.” Little eagle said, “I don’t know what that thing sounds like, but I’m following her, anyhow.” And they went out in the barnyard and begin to scratch in manure piles. And she, “Cluck, cluck, cluck. This is good. This is good. You join ours. And this is what … ” That little old eagle, he couldn’t eat that stuff. See? He just went along with the chicken because he didn’t know. He didn’t know what to do. And then she went out there, and she would get this or that. And the little eagle just … he just had to stomach it, but he didn’t know how to do it. But he had seen all the chickens doing it, but there’s something different. He didn’t like that. So, one day, the mother knowed that she had laid two eggs. So she begin to hunt for that other one, flying around, searching, like the great Holy Spirit. One day he flew over the barnyard, that denomination. She looked down there, and she seen her baby. She screamed. It was the Voice of something that echoed from the inside of him. [Blank spot on tape] Oh, That sounds right! Oh! Let a real predestinated-born germ, predestinated by God, hear the Word of God, It’s music to him. He knows It’s the Truth. He’s tired of that denominational stuff, anyhow, “Join us. Come, go with us. We got a social party. We got this. We got … ” It just didn’t sound right, to the little fellow. She said, “Son, you don’t belong in that group, anyhow. You belong to me. You’re mine.” He said, “Mama, that sounds real. How am I going to get out?” “Just make a jump. I’ll catch you.” Uh-huh. That’s all you have to do. The anointed Word of God being vindicated before any man that’s born to be a son of God, with the predestinated germ into him for this hour, he’ll see God’s Message as sure as there’s a God in Heaven. Martin Luther saw It for his. Wesley saw It for his. The pentecostal saw It for his. Now what about you? Uh-huh. They went into a denomination. Here is the Word condemning it; telling you what we’re to have today, and just exactly Malachi 4 and all these other promises for the hour. What do you see? What are you looking at? Amen. Here we are. The real, genuine eagles hear. “My sheep know My Voice. A stranger they’ll not follow.” Why? It was put in there by predestination. You were foreordained to a son of God. You were in God before the foundation of the world. You’re only manifested in this day for His honor and glory. How can you do it without honoring His Word, and stand with every Word of God? Yes, sir. Which, you are a part of that Word, by predestination. Because, look, the God is the Word. You believe it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Well, then, if … He always was the Word. “In the beginning was the Word.” And if the Word was God, then you were in God. The Word, the part that you’re to play, was in God before the foundation of the world. He seen you. He knew you. He predestinated you to it. I tell you, just as that eagle recognized that voice, so does a real, born-again Christian recognize the Voice of God speaking through the Word, when they see It anointed and a vindicated. Look. He looked up There. He didn’t see this old hen cluck-cluck around here, “Join us and go over here. And go this, and go to this and that.” He saw a being like he wanted to be, sailing in the air, screaming, free, up in the highs, above all the vultures and things of the earth. Hallelujah! He wanted to be that because it was in him to be that. And a man that’s born of God, a son of God, has to have the nature of God. He has to be like God. He honors God. He is part of the Word of God. And in this last days, of this Bride taking form, just exactly the same power that He was in at the beginning, has come up through these organizations, and so forth, and come out for the Bride. He can’t be nothing else but that. They ought to have seen It, them Jews in their days, when they seen It manifested there before them, as the prophet said He was. He said, “Search the Scriptures; in Them you think you have Eternal Life. They are They that testify of Me. If I do not the works of My Father, don’t believe Me. But though you can’t believe Me, do the … believe the works that I’ve done.” They said, “Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness for forty years. We know where we’re at.” He said, “And they’re every one dead,” that’s, Eternally separated. Everyone died. There was only three, two come out of a million, two million. That’s one in a million. Why, an injection, the sperm from male and female, there’s usually one egg fertile. There’s one egg, one germ that’s fertile, you ever seen hybreeding in cattle. Notice. Here is a million eggs; here is a million germs; and when they are discharged, to come together to the womb, coming through the tube and into the womb, they meet. One of them is eggs. A million eggs; a million germs. There’s only one egg in there fertile. There’s only one germ fertile. They’re all alive. You can watch them little calves beating around in there, a speck that you could put on a match stem. And Demos and them is listening in tonight, and he remembers when we took them. He took me down there, showed me how that worked. Test tubes, and put just in enough that you could put on the end of a match. It was thousands of little calves and bulls in there, but it’s only one of them can live. Only one of them! And here is a big ball of them, here. And you’ll notice, one will crawl out from among this one here, go right over, the germ come over here; and an egg will come out from among these other eggs over here, and they’ll meet together. And the rest of them die. Yet, they’re alive, but they die. Because, there is Something, Someone made this one fertile, and ordained this one, too. It’s predestination, my brother. Sure. God has to determine whether it’s going to be boy or girl, red-head, black-head, or whatever it is. It’s determined by God. More mystery than a virgin birth, to me. But, notice, the rest of them die. There were two million people come out, sung, shouted, done everything. Spoke in … not ever spoke in tongues. But they shouted, and give God glory, and danced up-and-down the sea, and done everything that all the rest of them did, but there were only two went into the promised land. Caleb went in, Caleb and Joshua, only two. That’s one out of a million. It’s one out of a million in natural birth. Every one of them had the same blessing. Oh, you Pentecostals, I hope you don’t wake up too late. One out of a million. Look. There is supposed to be five hundred million so-called Christians in the world today. If Jesus would come, there’d only be five hundred go with Him, then, if that statistic would run true. Why, there’s more than that missing every day, over the world. They know nothing about it. “‘I understand,’ said the scribes, ‘you know that … ’ Why does the scribes say that, ‘Elias must first come’?” They said to Jesus. He said, “Elias has already come and you didn’t know it.” See? He did just exactly what the Scriptures said was to happen to Him. See? “So must the Son of man suffer. Under … ” They didn’t recognize Him. Yet, they were all in the church. All claimed to be alive. And you just let a real, born-again Christian, a real servant of God, hear that Word of God, he’ll come right out through every denomination, to that real fertile ground, by the Word, the bedding ground. He’ll just do it. I don’t know how he does it. God has ordained it to be done. You was deceived in the beginning, by your first marriage. Now you know what’s true. Just like I said, the little eagle when he heard the Bridegroom’s Voice, he went to It, the anointed, vindicated Word of God for the last day. Noah was the vindicated Word for his day. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Well, his message won’t work today. Moses was the vindicated Word of his day. Do you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] It won’t work for now. Jesus was … John was the vindicated Word. You believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] It wouldn’t work in the days of Jesus. Certainly not. No, sir. “Law and prophets were until John; since then, the Kingdom of Heaven.” The apostles, them who set forth the Bible. Here come Luther out, in reformation, his words, that, his church, won’t work today. Wesley’s won’t. Pentecostal’s won’t. It worked in their day. But it’s another day. This is the opening of the Seven Seals. I know It sounds strange to you, but God has vindicate it so perfectly. There’s no question in It. Just perfectly! I ain’t scattering that to the local assembly here. I’m speaking to the people out across the nation. See? Do what you wish to. Now notice the anointed Word of his day, of which you are a part, by predestination. You immediately, like, knew. When you heard That, you knew right quick that you was an eagle. You also realized that you wasn’t a denominational chicken, to begin with. You knowed there is something wrong there. There is something wrong, that’s right, for you know that you were trapped into it, at the beginning. He, the Bridegroom, took away your shame, “And put it in the Sea of Forgetfulness, by the washing of the Water of the Word and the Blood of Life.” That’s what the Bible said. Your first husband that you were married to, the world; the anointed Bridegroom, which foreordained you, has washed you by the washing of the Water. By “the church”? [Congregation says, “No.”] That don’t sound right. Does it? [“No.”] You might find that in the almanac, but not in God’s Bible. “By the washing of the Water by the Word.” In the Word! See? By the … You are standing completely justified, as though you never did it at the beginning. This is my Message to the Church now. As you … as we go off the air, just in a minute. You are standing, if you’re standing on God’s Word and with God’s Word, every amen, every jot, every tittle. Where you standing? I’m trying to tell you, pull away from them shucks. And get out here in the wheat, where you can get ripe before the Son. I hear the coming of the combine. You’re standing complete, justified, like you never did it in the first place. Hallelujah! Talk about a thanksgiving! I feel real good. I’m more thankful for that than anything I know of. You are the pure, virtuous, sinless Bride of the Son of the living God. Every man and woman that’s born of the Spirit of God, and washed in the Blood of Jesus Christ, and believes every Word of God, stands as though you never sinned at the first place. You are perfect. The Blood of Jesus Christ! How can you … If a man … If I was supposed to die in the morning, a man took my place, I cannot die for that sin. Somebody took my place. And Jesus, the Word, took my place. He become me, that a sinner, that I might become Him, the Word. Amen. Let me hold true to It, not the church. The Word! Amen. Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and His Church now, when the flesh is becoming Word, and the Word is becoming flesh, manifested, vindicated. Just what the Bible said would happen in this day, it’s happening, day by day. Why, it’s cumulating so fast out there, in those deserts, and things taking place, that I couldn’t even keep up with it. We’re near the Coming of Jesus, to be united with His Church, where the Word becomes the Word. Call of the Holy Spirit, searching the hearts! You’re standing, completely. You never sinned at the first place. God don’t even know. It’s in the Sea of Forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it, by the accuser. But really, from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God. You’re standing there, washed. And your old book of divorcement is put away, and it’s dead, absolutely out of existence, even in the mind of God. You’re the virtuous Bride of Christ, washed in the Blood of Christ. Precious, virtuous, sinless Son of God standing with a pure, unadulterated Bride-Word that He washed by the Water of His Own Blood; that become flesh and manifested, that He might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the Father, before the beginning, the same as He was. He was that great attribute of God, called “love.” Whatever you are, you are servants of God, whatever God wants you to do, where your place is. “God placed in the Church, some apostles, prophets, teachers, pastors … ” He placed that by virtue of His Own predestination. And you were that, to begin with. Your first wedding was annulled. It was. You never done it, in the first place. Because, there’s only one thing could do it, that would be God come down, Himself, and took your place in a form of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and washed you by the Water, of the washing of the Water by the Word. The Word; not the denomination! The Word washed you. But if you won’t stand in the Water of the Word, how you going to be washed? You’re still as spotted as Eve was. Oh, dear dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood Shall never lose Its power, Till all the ransomed Church of God Be saved to sin no more. What is sin? Sin is “unbelief.” Unbelief in (what?) the Word; unbelief in God, which is the Word. Pure, unadulterated; oh, hallelujah; leaving soon for the skies; amen; standing ready. Think. Your garments, washed by the Water of the bleeding Word! The Word become Blood. The Word bled for you, and you are washed in bleeding Word. The Word, bleeding! The Life of God in the Word, and the Word was bled for you, that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes, and be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the Water of the Word, and makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on His Word. Now, how you know It’s true? When God comes down and vindicates It and prove. You say, “Well, I didn’t believe It that way.” They didn’t believe It Jesus’ way, but God proved It. They didn’t believe It Noah’s way. They didn’t believe It Moses’ way. They was willing to take Balaam’s word for It, “We’re all the same, so let’s just associate together.” “Separate yourself,” the Bible said, “from unbelief.” Hallelujah! Now notice. You’re not only that, but you’re going to the Wedding in the sky. And you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated, unmerited grace, a wedding band of grace unmerited of your own. God did it, Himself. He knew you before the foundation of the world, so He slipped the wedding band on you There, put your name on a Book. What a thanksgiving! Hallelujah! Praise our God! Now, in closing, I might say this. We all know that the modern church, Pentecostal, in its present condition … All the denominations together, I’ll throw them all in one bundle, because they are. You remember, He’s going to bundle the weeds, first, and burn them. Take the … He takes all the wheat stalks and burn it all up, first; then He take, come and gets His wheat and takes it Home. They’re all gathering in a bundle, bundle of Methodists, Baptists, Pentecostals, all going to Ecumenical Council. That’s all. They’re all burned. See? We all know that the modern church, in its present condition and its present state, is in no condition to finish up the great commission that God gave the Church for this day. How many Pentecostal can say “amen” to that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Right. See? It’s in … We’re oneness, twoness, threeness, this, that, other, fuss, fight. One is this, and one is that, and other. And every one of them, afraid to face the Word, right down to the test. See? They know. You tell them about It; they say, “I can’t help it. I can’t believe That. I don’t care what he does. I … ” See? See? See? Shows what mammy and pappy you have. “You might be a state presbyter someday. You might be this, that, or the other.” You better be a son of God. Now, we know that the church could not, the Pentecostal church, by no means, by no means, could carry out the last-day Message, in its present condition. Could it? [Congregation says, “No.”] Why, it can’t even agree on one or two Words in the Bible. How you going to do it? It can’t do it. So, you see, denomination is out. That’s right. It’s going to be an elected people that’s elected for it. See? Know, and so do every one of us know, that the whole rank of denominationals, Pentecostal and all, are dead, that is, to the born-again Christian of the Message. Uh-huh. Your first husband is dead. You know he’s dead. God let it die. It’s finished. All of its scientific, intellectual, educational, scientific ways of its so-called Bible schools and things is perished. What’s it done? Separated, oneness here, and trinities here, and twoness here, and over here, and down here, and such a mess up, and call themselves Pentecostals. Why, I went to a young man, other day; is listening right in, right now. And a young woman, she belonged to a certain church. She said … I said … They separated. I said, “What’s the matter?” Said, “We’re a different faith.” I said, “Oh, I’m sorry. Are you Catholic?” She said, “No.” She told me the denomination church she belonged to, a Pentecostal. I said, “What are you?” He’s Pentecostal, too, but another denomination. Oh! You know, the Roman Catholic church started off, Pentecostal? How many knows that true? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] It taken it two thousand years to get where it’s got now, just don’t take nothing of the Scripture no more. Nothing. Why, the Pentecostal, in twenty years from now, will be worse than they are now, it keeps on going the way it is now. Why, sure. See? What is it? What is it? Look who their papa and mama is. Let their women cut their hair. They can do nearly anything they want to. “As long as they belong to this church, that’s all is necessary.” Oh, no wonder, no wonder the damnation of God heaps up! God put It right before your eyes and you shut your eyes and fail to look at It. Yeah. Shutting up your bowels of compassion, when you see the true Word of God and these Seven Seals being vindicated and proved to be so. And witness in the heavens, across the nations and everywhere else, by great signs and wonders that He promised He would do, then you shut up, say, “I don’t know. I can’t help it. I … ” See? Oh, my! It’s dead, and don’t know it. Sins and trespasses! You’re dead. Oh, my! We all know that the church in that condition couldn’t finish up this last day. How could it bring Malachi 4 in? How could it do it? They don’t even believe in such a thing. How could it believe, bring in Luke 17:30? How could it bring in all these other Scriptures that’s promised this last day? It couldn’t do it, because it denies It. “As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the Coming of the Son of man.” Look at the condition, Lot, that Sodom was in, in that day. Look, condition of the church in the day. Look what happened to Abraham, the Elected. Look what happened to Lot and them down in Sodom. Look at the Billy Graham and Oral Roberts, them down there amongst those denomination. Look at the elected Abraham Church, pulled out. Look what kind of sign, that Jesus Himself, the incarnated God standing there in human flesh. You say, “That was an Angel.” The Bible said It was God. Lord God, Elohim, standing there in human flesh, showing that He would so anoint His Church in the last days. It’d be God working in human flesh again. “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the Coming of the Son of man.” Same kind of a thing. They see it right there in the Scriptures. Read the … “Search the Scriptures, for in Them you think you have Eternal Life.” And They are They that testify of This. See? See? So we know they’re dead. God let it die in its own selfish, scientific, educational program. All the Pentecostals used to talk about sending their kid away to Bible school, back when old Brother Loyate, them was around here, and they’d run you out of the church. “But, oh, now it’s the greatest thing. My son is away in Bible school.” He’s digging his grave. So, now, you think they could take It, today? You think I’m trying to support ignorance? I’m not. I’m telling you there’s a difference between this intellectual age that we’re living in, where the church has been pregnated with science and all these so-called “figured out” and everything. You don’t figure out God. Well, them priests had God figured out so perfect. They knowed how the Messiah was going to come, but He come so different from what they had figured out. It wasn’t scientific. “How could this Man, being an illegitimate Child? Where did He go to school at? Where did His education come from? Where did He get this learning?” “Why, You try to teach us? You’re born in fornications.” See? Oh, for goodness sake! See the same thing repeat again? [The congregation says, “Amen.”] See it repeat again? All in their religious science, religious science according to what their Bible school said, that’s the way they want It. “That’s the way It has to be, or It isn’t.” God just fools them, every time. It always comes different. It did in Noah’s time; did in Moses’ time; did in Christ’s time; did in John’s time; did in disciples’ time; did in Wesley’s time; did in Luther’s time; did in Pentecostal time; and so has it again. It don’t change Its pattern. Always comes the same thing. Only reformers through them seven … six ages, till the seventh. And Revelation 10 said, in this hour it’ll change. And it did. Now we’re closing, in saying this. Finish up the great commission, how could they do it? We know they’re dead. God let it die in this scientific age, all of it, so He could (do what?) open up the Seven-Seal mystery to the undenominational Bride. How can a denomination accept those Seven Seals, when It’s absolutely contrary, serpent’s seed and all those other things? The whole, full seven mysteries is contrary to what they’ve been taught, because they took the old school from their Bible school. And the Seven Seals of God, when It was opened there on the mountain: let God, no, let me die right now at this pulpit if That ain’t the Truth. And I foretold you, a year and six months before it happened, what He told me, “Go to Arizona,” and what would happen out there in the desert. And there’s men setting right here, tonight, was standing right there and present when the seven Angels come down. And even mag- … The magazine, Life magazine, packed the article of It. It’s right there in the observatory, and everything. Now they don’t even know what It’s all about. And everything has been said, oh, even to the destruction of California, coming up now, and all these other things. And how I told them how many days it would be, how it would be where this big earthquake happened in Alaska, and that would be the beginning of the sign of time, and what would take place. And just word by word, what It said, it’s never failed one time. You’ve never seen It fail. And It can’t fail, because It’s God’s Words. “And Heaven and earth will pass away, but It can’t fail.” That’s right. God had to open up those Seven Seals, not in a denomination. I’ve always been against it. But, out of the denomination, He might take a Bride, not a denominational bride. He couldn’t do it. It’s against His Own Word. He opened those seven mysteries in there. That shows forth, brings forth those things that’s been hid since the foundation of the world, might be revealed in the last days, to sons of God. They brought That forth now before the people, that they see It, there, you now, to this undenominational Bride. Oh, my! There is your two books. One of them is the Lamb’s Book of Life. Your name on There is predestinated on There. It can’t go, because you can no more take that away than nothing, see, because it was foreordained to be on There. But the regular book of life, can take that off at any time. See? You don’t repent, it’s off, anyhow, ’cause you’re going to stand the Judgment. The Bride don’t even stand the Judgment; goes in the Rapture. Just as … I say this, in closing. It’s getting late, so … it’s almost nine-thirty. And we’re going to be out of here by nine-thirty, the Lord willing. Just real reverent now, listen. One time … Saying this now, this goes across the nation. In New York, now it’s twenty-five minutes after eleven. Way up in Philadelphia and around through there, those dear saints setting there listening, right now, in churches all around. Way up, way down around Mexico, way up around in Canada and all around, across. Two hundred miles, anywhere within the North America continent here, almost, people is at it, listening right now. Thousands times thousands, listening. And that’s my Message to you, Church, you that’s a union, spiritual union by the Word, that you’re dead to these old husbands. You’re born anew. Don’t try to dig him up. He’s dead. If you’re a born-again Christian, that little germ that was predestinated to you, it’s Word coming on Word, on Word, on Word, on Word, and come into full stature of Christ, that’s right, so He can come get His Bride. Now we’re just ready for one thing, that’s the Coming of the Lord. There is your name on the Book of Life. The Book of Life is the Word of God, ’cause the Word is God, and God is the only thing that is Life. So your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible become on Word. And if you’re here to do that, won’t It vindicate that Word? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Won’t the Church vindicate Itself? Won’t Malachi 4, and all these other things, perfectly, perfectly vindicate Itself and show that That’s what It is? [“Amen.”] When Jesus come, He said, “If I do not the works was promised for Me to do, don’t believe Me.” Which one of the groups did He join? He said, “They all … You’re of your father, the devil, and his works you do.” See? See? We’re in the last days, Church. That’s my thanksgiving Message to you. Now, before closing. One time I was up in Glacier National Park. We had heard, all day long, that they had a fall … a glacier fire that was going to fall at night. So the people was busy, all day long, getting that thing ready, because they was going to pour that fire out, that night. They put a liquid fire falls, like a great glacier of water. But it’s … Looked like a rainbow, almost, when it comes out, of that fire falling out of this glacier. All around through the park, wife and I, and children, walked around through the day. We wanted to stay, to see that fire exhibition. So it was promised us that we would see it, and we’d witness it again. They said they have it ever through the summer seasons and so forth. I said, “Well, will we be able to see it?” Said, “We promised it tonight. We’re promised that.” Said, “They’re up there getting it ready now.” After all had been made ready for the event! That’s what’s taking place right now. All is being made ready for the event, a Church being pulled out for His Name’s sake, taking His Bride out from amongst the world, these denominations and all the world, and the filth and things of the world. Everybody; the event was made ready. Everybody was standing out. They said, “Now keep watching, right up on top the mountain there.” That’s the way It’s always come. That’s the way It’s to come this time. That’s the way It always come. Not through a denomination! Never did God use a denomination, never! The reformer goes forth, he gets the Word of the Lord. And then when he dies, they build a denomination out of it. That’s what the Pentecostals and all did. When the new issues and everything, that’s just the way, that’s the way the thing come out. A new word added, then they build a church out of it, made a denomination, separated themself. It had to be that way. Now, you can’t beat nature. Nature falls in the same routine, all the time: stalk, leaf, tassel, so forth, shuck, then the wheat. Now notice. All was ready. Everything had been kindled and made ready. And everybody was standing out. I had my head sticking up; my arm around my wife. We was looking. And children standing there, all of us looking up, like that. My! It was something, ’cause we was expecting it. It was promised to us. Amen! The Word promises This. “It shall come to pass, before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come, behold, I will send unto you Elijah the prophet. He shall turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers, and the hearts of the … ” “It shall come to pass in the last days, I’ll pour out My Spirit from on High.” “The former and latter rain shall come together in the last day.” All these promises, through the Scriptures, been given. We’re looking upward. Watch at the true Bride across the nation this hour, looking up. Church, He is coming, one of these days. Just as sure as He come the first time, He is coming again. Get everything ready. Separate yourself from shuck. Lay before the Son. Keep looking up. Be under expectation. All at once, we heard something from the top the hill, a voice come down through the loudspeaker, said, “All things are ready.” Then this man, standing right there by the side of me, said, “Let the fire fall.” Here it come, pouring down across that mountain, a glacier of fire and blazes a licking, a sight to behold. Brother, let’s get all things ready, for one of these days the Fire is going to fall. We’re going up. Now let’s get ready for the Fire-falling time. We’re in the last days, we all know that, and we’re ready for the Coming of the Lord. The thing to do is separate yourself from all sin. Separate yourself from anything that pertains to the world. “Don’t love the world or the things of the world.” “Let no man, by his creed, deceive you.” You stay right straight in the promise of God, the Word of God. And that Word, if It’s a Word for this day, God vindicates It so. If He doesn’t, it’s not the Word for this day. The Word that fell on the Day of Pentecost will not work this day. No, sir. That was for Pentecost. This is for the Bride, going Home of the Bride. We got something different. The Pentecostals represented that, again. We’re in the Bride age. No more than the Word of Noah would work in the days of Moses; no more than Moses’ law would have worked in the time of Paul here. He tried to tell them, “You are dead to that, and you cannot have that.” Church, you who I’m speaking to, tonight, across the nation, if you’ve separated yourself from denomination and all the filth and things of this world, and all those things that keeps you in man-made creeds and orders and things like that, you separated yourself: Look up. Get ready. The Fire is going to fall, one of these days. God is going to let Him come, and a sight to behold. Would you be ready when He comes? Would you be ready to go up with Him when He comes? The secret Rapture of the supernatural Bride, “She’ll be made mor- … from mortal to immortality; be changed, in a moment, in a twinkling of eye. We which are alive and remain shall not prevent them which are asleep.” The other day, on Armistice Day, I was standing down there in Tucson. My little boy wanted to see the parade. I was studying, and I didn’t have time to do it. And I had a lot of sick calls and things. So he said, “Daddy, they won’t take me.” He said, “Take me.” I said, “All right.” Brother Simpson, I think he’s here; and his little boy wanted to go. So I jerked them in the car and run down. I stood there on the corner and watched. And after while, I heard, way back in the distance, a muffle coming, “womp, womp,” drums, beating. I stood there. I thought, “Well, these little fellows, they really read all these books about army. They’ll really like that.” I noticed, coming up first was the old World War I tank. There they come up, little bitty fellows like that. There was next come, after that; was the next come after that was the big new tank of the Second World War, the big Sherman tank with a muzzle break on it. Then come the next, and the next, and after while come the Gold Star Mothers. And then, after while, come twelve veterans that’s left, in the whole state of Arizona, from the First World War; twelve veterans. After that, come a float, the unknown soldier, the little white cross. There stood a sailor, marine, and a soldier, standing guard; a little partition on the float. On the other side was an old gray-headed mother, setting with a gold star pinned on her, a little lovely wife crying, her husband was dead; a little ragged boy, his head turned sideways. His daddy was killed. And then behind that come more and more and more, and then to the new army. I stood there. What a sight to behold, but how sad! I thought, “O God, one of these days I’m going to behold another sight.” There’ll come forth a resurrection day, which, “The first will be last; they which are last will be first.” The old prophets will come breaking forth, first, and they see that procession going, marching up in the air. “And we which are alive and remain shall not hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound, the dead in Christ shall rise first.” We’ll fall right in line with them going in, hallelujah, all down through the age of Luther, Wesley, Methodist, Presbyterian, on down to the last age, who received the Word in their age. God bless you. Get all things ready, and the Fire will fall. Let’s bow our heads just a moment. I wonder, in this visible audience tonight, while I’ve held you here for … till nine-thirty. Is there one here, is there a dozen here, how many here, and says, “Brother Branham, I’m ashamed of myself, the way I’ve lived. I have catered a lot to a denomination and men. I know that I’m not up with the Word of God. I’m just going to ask you to pray for me, Brother Branham”? Raise up your hand. God bless you. God bless you. Just look, way up into the balconies, around. God bless you. “I know … ” Now don’t be ashamed. Now, don’t be. And out yonder, across the nation, from New York to California, from Canada to Mexico: you people that’s gathered in those churches (where those faithful little groups that’s believed this Message with all their hearts; they’ve come out, come out of great tribulation, come out through those denominations; they’re germs of Life) do you feel the urging, tonight, like the little eagle, that you hear Something that’s a little different from what you’ve heard, but, yet, in your heart you know it’s the Truth? You, in there, there’s a pastor standing there somewhere. You got your hand up. I’m going to pray for you. These things wasn’t done in a corner, friend. Remember, “Strait is the gate and narrow is the way, and but few there’ll be that will find it.” Don’t go with that crowd that’s moving on yonder, friend, that Laodicea Church Age. It could jump up-and-down, dance under music, lukewarm. Didn’t say it was ice cold now. It said, “It was lukewarm,” that’s the Pentecostal, “and don’t know that it’s miserable, wretched, blind.” Blind to what? The Word, to the manifestation of the Word; because It never come through their organizations, they cannot receive It. And you ministers down there in Tucson, tonight, I don’t hold you responsible for that. God does. I was there for three years. I told you I wouldn’t start a church. I didn’t. Brother Pearry Green started it. I was there three years, and not one time did you invite me to your pulpit. I set in Tucson for nearly three years. God will take me from the desert one of these days. This Message must live. I tried my best to get in to you. I know the reason you did it. You hear? Only reason you did it, your denomination would kick you out. And you know, many of you I’ve talked to, there at Furr’s Restaurant, and you know it’s the truth. Shame on you. Come out of it. Get out of there, brother. If there’s any Life in you, you’ll be like that little eagle I just spoke of, you’ll hear the Word of God. Remember, you’re going to hear This for the last time, one of these days. We’re real close now. Won’t you come, tonight? Dear God, we set solemnly now, a thanksgiving day it really is, Lord. I am grateful, Lord, to be living in this day. This is the greatest day. Paul the apostle longed to see this day. The great men of old longed to see it. The prophets longed to see it. They looked for this day. Abraham looked for this day, for he sought for a City whose Builder and Maker was God; it hangs right above us, tonight. John seen the Spirit of God descending out of Heaven, bore record, knowed that that was the Son of God. And, think now, He’s choosing His Bride. Dear God, out across the land everywhere, speak to their heart. You’re the only One can change their heart. If that wasn’t Seed put in there at the beginning, they’ll never see It, Lord. They’re just … “The blind will lead the blind. They’ll fall in the ditch,” as sure as anything, because Your Word says they will. Now, Father, being that we see across the country, around the world, in Africa, dozens, dozens through South Africa, Mozambique, all across the country, little assemblies taking these tapes. And so will this tape go to twenty-some odd, different nations. They’re beginning to see It and pull away, hundreds and hundreds of them. Won’t take many, Lord. Then when the last member is received into the Body, Christ will come. Lord God, I’m asking the Bride, tonight, the ones that I feel has pulled away and waiting, may they separate themselves from everything in the world. They must lay in the Presence of the warm Son Light of the Son of God, bathing in His Word, in His love. Grant it, dear God. May these people here, visible, that held up their hand, tonight, dozens of them through this great tabernacle. I pray, God, that new Life will come into them; I pray it, for across the nation and even around the world, where the tape will be played, that they also will receive this Thanksgiving Message and know, by the hints and things that’s been throwed, what they must do. I pray it, Father. Grant it. Bless them. They’re Yours. I know it’s customary now, Father, that we ask the people to the altar. And I pray, dear God, that in every mission, everywhere around, and in across the world, that they will come to the altar: the black, the white, yellow, brown, wherever they are; the rich, the poor, the indifferent, the beggars, whatever they are. The denominationals, those who set self-styled and self-centered, O God, “Naked, miserable, wretched, blind, and don’t even know it.” You said it would be that way, and it’s that way. So I pray, Father, that You’ll call every Seed, tonight. And everywhere around the world that This may fall, may It catch that little eagle that knows the Voice of his Lord. Grant it, Lord. I commit them to You, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. Now with your heads bowed, here in the visible audience. Would some here, that hasn’t been saved, not even given your heart to God, don’t you think you ought to be thankful for what Jesus did for you? To think, that you are a sinner, that you’re an alien from God, and yet Something at your heart, knocking. [Brother Branham knocks on the pulpit] How do you know but what you are one of those little eagles! You are miserable, and will be miserable, till you surrender to It. Why not make this one of the greatest thanksgiving you ever had, when you received Jesus Christ as your Saviour. Will you come up here and stand at the altar? I’ll pray with you if you will come, any sinner, man or woman, boy or girl, church member or not church member. Church member doesn’t make you a Christian now. The altar is open. Will you come, any sinner that would want to come, receive the Lord Jesus Christ. Would like to really quit … Some of you denominationals that would like to quit feeding on that chicken food, of saying, “You belong to this and it’s all right.” You really want to know what the real baptism of the Holy Ghost is? Come, find out. The altar is open. We’re ready. Just come right up, out of your seat. Come right on up and kneel down here at the altar, this brother that’s just come. “Thanksgiving, O God, I’m so thankful to You. That, all my life, I’ve knowed there’s been something, Lord. I’ve never been satisfied. I’ve tried. I thought, ‘Next year, I’ll do it. The next week, I’ll do it, next time I hear an altar call. I will, someday.’ I put it off, and put it off. But, Lord, I know there is something wrong with me. I always believed that there was something different. And now, Lord, tonight, I’m thankful for a preparation that’s been made by the Son of God, that my sins, actually my unbelief, would be washed away from me. I’m coming, tonight, and kneel down to accept the great thanksgiving blessing that Jesus Christ did for me when He died for me at Calvary.” Will you come? Now there’s people kneeling around the altar here. Why don’t you get up and come? You’ve wanted to do it. You’ve tried it. Just think of Brother Lyle Palmer, our good, precious brother. He was setting in the yard, so I understand, looking at his little girl playing croquet out there, or something, and he pitched over in the chair and was dead before he could even make a move. You don’t know what time you’re going to leave here. You just don’t know what time that you’re going. It may be yet, tonight, so why not come and settle it now? Come on, people. Can’t you feel Something tugging at you? I know there’s many of you here that should be right here at the altar, and just this six or seven people here is not what is setting in here. Now, if you believe me and watch here at the platform, things happening, you believe me now. One day my voice will be stilled. You won’t hear it no more. You might wish you would have come. You say, “But, Brother Branham, I been a church member.” That don’t make any difference what you’ve been. So had Nicodemus been a church member. So had John, Peter, James, Paul, all the rest of them been church members. Paul was a church member until something happened one night, or one day it was, and he come. He was a changed church member then, to a son of God. Won’t you come? Oh, he was trained. He was intellectual. He knowed he was trained, one of the greatest-trained schools there was, Gamaliel, one of the finest teachers there was in the land. But he knowed he needed something. Won’t you come? Once more I ask you. In where … Here or around the nation, I ask you, wherever you are, in what assembly you are, at this thanksgiving hour. Remember, I’m being taped here; not only here, but in Heaven. You know, it’s scientifically proved that every move you make is recorded. They prove that. Remember, television proved that. The television doesn’t manufacture the picture. You’re the picture. It just transmits that, what you’re doing, into a channel. You’re there, anyhow. See? When you move your finger, that move goes around the world. Every time that you put on a dress, your looks goes around the world. It’s on a record. Every thought that goes through your mind is on a record. And someday the record is going to quit playing, it’s going to be put in the album. And then at the Judgment it’s going to be come back. There you stand with bobbed hair, claiming to be a Christian. There you stand with thoughts in your mind against the Word, and it’s right in your mind. You can’t hide it. Remember, television, science even knows that’s true. You standing right now, knowing that you should be here, remember, when this is recorded, at the Day of the Judgment, that same thought that you’re having will be coming right back through your mind again. That will be right on record. The whole world will see it played. Why don’t the world … Looking at you, on the Day of the Judgment, all the Angels there. “If you’re ashamed of Me here, when your picture is being made now, at the Day of the Judgment I’ll be ashamed of you. For, I anointed My Word, sent It to you. You wouldn’t believe It. You hid yourself behind something.” “Oh,” you say, “I’m good enough. I’ve done this. I’ve danced in the Spirit. I’ve spoke in tongues.” So does the heathen. “I shouted.” So does the heathen. How can you turn back on the Word then? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why do you wait, dear brother? Oh, why do you tarry so long? Jesus is waiting to save you A place in His sanctified Home. Put you one of the members of His Body! Why not? Oh, little eagle, come now. Oh, why not come? Lord, I’m thankful. I’m very thankful. Thanksgiving to You, Lord; not for natural food, yet that. But, Lord, the end time is here. I’m thankful for this spiritual Food, Lord, the spiritual Food of the Seven Seals was promised to be opened. You say, “That’ll be something different.” No, no. You can’t add one word. And take … It’s already in There, just hid. It’s sealed. How many understands that? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen.”] See? You say, “Well, that’s a mystery will come forth.” Oh, no. It’s already Writ. You can’t add one word to It, or take one from It. See? It’s already in There. It’s just got to be revealed in the last day. Won’t you come? Come on now, friend. If you can’t understand, come. Kneel down, talk to Him about It. If I can’t make It plain to you, He will, for He is a Dissolver of all doubts.  … in His sanctified throne. Oh, why … (Won’t you come?) Why not? Why not come to Him now? Remember, there’s a recording making of this, not only on this tape, but God’s great record. Each one of you, every move, when you bow your head, bow your heart, what thought goes through your mind, remember, it’s being recorded right now in Glory, and the record is going to be played on the Day of Judgment. Where is your decision? Oh, how you’ll want it changed, at that Day. I’m just going to wait, ’cause there’s many, many, around the altar now. See? Maybe one of them, if I held just a little longer, there might be another one out there, might be somewhere in New York, it might be somewhere in Philadelphia, out in California, Arizona. Somewhere, there might be another one coming. Pastor, wherever you are, don’t give the altar call up now. We may never see another Thanksgiving. This might be the last one, and records will be put up, tonight, for the last time. The tape will run out, one of these days. The record will be cut and will be in God’s album. Then it’s going to be played back, what your thoughts is now. Don’t say you didn’t know different. You do. “But no man can come to Me, except My Father draws him. And all the Father has given Me, they will come.”  … come to Him? Brother, I believe, if I was setting out there somewhere, and I had the least thought, I’d sure take up here as hard as I could. Yeah. Oh, why not? Why? Are you finished? You sure you’re not grieving His Spirit now? Let’s keep our heads bowed then. You sure you haven’t grieved His Spirit? You sure you’ve done just exactly what He told you to do? You positive now? Remember, you might not never have another chance. The record may be finished up, tonight. This may be all of it. This may be the last tape for you. Are you sure you’re ready now? If so, I leave it in your hands, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Now while the choir is singing softly, I’m going to pray for these that’s down here. I’m just kind of a very odd sort of a Christian. I believe that God has to do the saving. I believe God has to plant the Word. “I the Lord,” says the Bible, Isaiah, “I the Lord hath planted It. I’ll water It, day and night, lest some should pluck It from My hand.” Before I ask anyone to come around the altar with these people, I want to pray for them, myself. Let’s bow our heads now. Dear Jesus, I just quoted Your Word, that Your prophet said, and I know the words of the prophets are true. And You said, “I the Lord hath planted It.” Why, certainly, You put It on the Lamb’s Book of Life, before the foundation of the world. “I the Lord hath planted It, and I’ll water It, day and night, unless some should pluck It from My hand.” These, probably, Lord, has heard a many altar call. But You’re still watering at It, Lord. Here they are, tonight. May they just turn loose, tonight, Father, from all of the things of the world, all the sins and troubles that’s in their heart, and just sanely, reverently, in their heart, turn loose to Your Word, right now, and say, “Lord Jesus, down in my heart, I’ve always believed that there was something for me, that I never have received yet. Though I’ve tried, as the expression has been made tonight, to follow the hen, but there was something seemed strange to me. It didn’t sound just right. Then, tonight, I feel that I’m coming now closer into the arms of the living Word. I’m coming here just as reverently, in my right mind. I’ve settled down here by this altar. I want salvation, Lord, so bad. I’m so hungry! I want You, Lord, to hold me in Your arms, tonight. Not through any emotion, but through the Spirit of love, take me into Your arms, dear God.” “I’m Your child. I feel that I’m that eagle they were talking about. Catch me, Lord. I’m jumping. I raised up from my seat, and knelt down here. Catch me, Lord. I’m jumping. Bring me on Your wings, Lord, away from these things of the world. Let me fly away from the filth of this world, from my bad habit, from all my denominational tradition. Let me come only to You, dear God, that Your Holy Spirit might pour into me the forgiveness of all of my doubts. May I, tonight, become Your child, fresh, born, and a new creature, tonight. Catch me. Carry me away, beyond the clucking of the hen. Carry me away, to the Eagle’s nest, where there that I could be nurtured by the Word of God, until I’m able to fly.” Grant it, dear God. Take them. They are Yours. This is my prayer with sincerity, praying over dying people. Grant it, Father. I offer this prayer in their behalf. For the glory of God, I ask it. Now with our heads bowed. I wonder, around the altar now, it’s you that’s knelt here. Many of you has claimed to be Christians, but you’ve felt that there’s always something, somewhere, that you didn’t possess. You might have done all the religious act. You might have shouted. You might have done all things. Might have danced in the Spirit. You might have spoke in tongues. And no one can say anything wrong against that. That’s true. That’s all good. But, you see, that’s gifts of the Spirit, without the Spirit. If the Spirit was there, that feeling wouldn’t be feeling condemned like that. Do you really, sincerely, here at the altar, believe that right now, while you’re here, that just the act of turning yourself loose, not an emotion now, but in genuine, unadulterated faith, that God will receive you and nurture you with His Word until you are eagles, yourself, and can fly? If you do, and you want God to do that, raise up your hand, you that’s around the altar down here. God bless you. Each one has their hands up. Now, real quietly, I’m going to ask consecrated men and women who really know God. Most of them, it’s very strange, it seems like it’s that way, altar calls that I make is mostly all men. You know, in a regular run, it’s women. But it’s all men here. I think there’s one woman at the altar, tonight, maybe two. It’s usually the women. But, somehow or another, I guess it seem like women think I talk against them. I don’t, sister. Three, I believe, somebody said they see. I can’t see over the top of the altar here. All right. Some of you consecrated Christians come here and stand with me in prayer just a minute. On the altar, wherever you are, on the platform, somebody that really knows God, just knows how to stand here just a few minutes for prayer with them, then we’ll dismiss the audience. Everybody be real reverent now. Don’t leave. Just come here and stand around. Some of you people that really believe This to be the Truth, that we’re entering another age. We’re entering the Rapture Age. You know the church can’t go in its condition, and it can’t get any better. It must get worse. How many knows that? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen.”] It’s got to get worse. And it can’t go like this. See? It’s got to be Something, and It’s moving right now, friend. It’s on, the move is on for the Bride. That’s the Truth. That’s THUS SAITH THE LORD. Move up now, consecrated Christians that wants your record to find out that, these who come sincerely, that you want to come and offer prayer with them, as your brothers and sisters, come up around the altar. Stand around here just a moment, for prayer. Someone else want to come? Stand around here. Just kneel down by them. Just walk, where you men around those men; you women. Sweetly, humbly ask prayer for them. Dear God, help …?… “I surrender all. I surrender my denomination. I surrender my first wedding. I surrender my first husband. I surrender everything, Lord.”  … -der all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. I surrender all, I surren- … You surrender your own idea? Can you surrender your own ideas, to God’s Word? All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender … All that believe now, in the audience, stand up. Let’s sing it, together, now. I surren- … You all surrender, ready to sing it now? I … To Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surren- … Now, you around the altar, if you really surrender, raise your hand up to Him, sing, “I surrender all. I surrender denomination. I surrender denomination. I surrender church. I surrender myself. I surrender my idea. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. To Thee, my … ” I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. Do you really mean it? I surrender all, [Blank spot on tape] You here now at the altar. You here that’s around the altar, that’s prayed. The church has prayed for you. You prayed, yourself. Now there’s only one way you can be saved, that’s, “By faith are ye saved, and that by grace.” The grace of God spoke to you, brought you to the altar. You’re seeking God’s blessings. You’re seeking His Word. You’re seeking the Holy Ghost. You’re seeking the favors of God. And if you are, and you can, really, with all your heart, surrender it. Now, don’t look for any emotion. Look for a Truth, a Truth that’s from your heart, by faith. “Lord, I’m willing to do anything that Your Word commands me to do. I surrender myself, with all that’s in me.” If you believe that with all your heart, I want you to raise up to your feet, turn around to this church, the audience, and raise your hands up, and we’ll sing it together with them, “I surrender everything that’s in me, God. As best of my knowledge, everything that I am, I surrender.” Step up on this platform here, you that’s at the altar. Step right up here on the platform, brethren, right up here, all of you, and brothers and sisters. Looky here, church. [A sister says, “Brother Branham, I belong to church, but lately I’m not even in it no more.”] Surrender? [“The Lord knows where I want to be led by Him. I want …?… to church. And I want the Holy Spirit, be filled with the Spirit. And I’d sooner die, if that’s what it takes.”] Yes. That’s right. Do you surrender every bit to Him and His Word? A sister here, out of a denomination. She said, “I belong to a denomination.” We don’t have to call it. She’s a worker in there. But she said, “Brother Branham, I want to get out to the Truth. I want something deeper than that.” See? Let me quote His Word. “Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.” Now, you here on the platform, that just come, if you are ready to surrender everything that you are, everything, to obey the Word of God. Nobody told you, this week, what to do. Now, if you’re ready to surrender right now to Him, just raise up your hands, like this, to the audience. Now, you here on the platform, let’s sing it together now, I Surrender All. Everybody, together. All right. I surrender all, Now really mean that! …?… Do you really mean it? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Say, “Amen,” once more. [“Amen.”] Say, “Lord,” [“Lord,”] “search me.” [“search me.”] “Try me.” [“Try me.”] “And give me an opportunity.” [“And give me an opportunity.”] “This is all I could do, tonight,” [“This is all I could do, tonight,”] “is give myself to You.” [“is give myself to You.”] “You know the hunger of my heart.” [“You know the hunger of my heart.”] “You know my desire.” [“You know my desire.”] “Your promise was to fill that desire.” [“Your promise was to fill that desire.”] “Now I accept it.” [“Now I accept it.”] “And I surrender to You.” [“And I surrender to You.”] All together. I surrender all, I surrender all. All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all. 
Minister brothers, and you friends out there, I say it’s a privilege to be here this morning. Such an introduction as that, why, I don’t know how I’m ever going to live up to that one. But just setting there talking, Brother Noel and I, I don’t believe I’ve ever met a person just exactly … We all are made in different molds, but by the same God. Like Brother Jack Moore, he’s certainly been … Brother Noel was just saying, “Since I’ve been here with him … ” That’s his son-in-law, and how he had learned to love him and respect his wisdom and things. And that … I can say “amen” to that. The many fine thing … times that we’ve had together, he and I, and Brother Brown, Brother Boutliere here. Fine men of God that I really love them with all my heart. And then I—I see we’re all not getting any younger, well, I just think of the time now that watching us as we change since about twenty years ago crossing the deserts, and so forth together as younger men. But just knowing that there is a Land where we’ll never get old. We’ll meet there again someday. Last night when I was leaving the tabernacle, there was a little lady laying back there on a cot, and she said, “Brother Branham, years ago … ” I think she had been paralyzed. She said, “You told me … ” I forget what the woman’s remark was now, something like this, I hope that I don’t misquote it. Said, “That this affliction I had would be for a purpose,” or something, that she would have a baby. And she couldn’t understand how that would be done and her in that condition. There stood a young, handsome-looking young man, he said, “I’m the baby that she had.” Said, “I’m the baby that she had.” And so many things has happened along the road, we don’t even have time here to talk it over. We will on the other side. And this Business Men’s chapter. I do not belong to any organization, I guess as you all know, but I … This is the only group that I’m connected with, pack a fellowship card, is … They are interdenominational, it’s just businessmen. They have been a great asset to me and to the type of ministry that the Lord our Father has given me. It’s … it wasn’t exactly that I don’t like the organization; it’s just a ministry that’s given to me, and if I am not loyal to that call, then I’ll be a disloyal person to God. And, I’m thinking, just before I left Tucson, maybe many of you were there, one day I was, Los Angeles speaking to the chapter. And there was … I had just raked the organization maybe a little—little hard. I—I didn’t mean to be that way. If you mean that to be mean, then I’d be a hypocrite. You mustn’t do that, no, that’s just throw off on someone. But I had talked about a tree that I saw in Brother Sharrit’s yard. It had about five different kinds of fruit on it. And I said, “I never seen a tree like that in my life.” It was a … it had grapefruit, it had lemons, it had tangerine, tangelos, oranges, everything growing on the same tree. “Well,” I said, “I—I sure don’t get that. What kind of a tree is it?” “It’s a orange tree.” And I said, “Well, that grapefruit?” Said, “Yeah.” I—I said, “How is that?” Said, “That’s grafted.” And I said, “Oh, I see.” He said, “They’re all of the citrus family, and any tree that’s of a citrus family be … can be grafted.” I said, “I understand.” Then I started shouting just a little bit, you know, ’cause I am nervous and emotionally. So, he said, “What’s the matter?” And I said, “Well, I was just thinking of something.” And I said, “Now I want to ask you a question.” I said, “Now, next year when the blooms come on, there won’t be oranges, tangelos, grapefruits, lemons; there’ll all be oranges because it’s in a orange tree, won’t it?” He said, “No, no. No, each branch bears of its own.” Said, “I see.” So that still was sounding real good, because I’m … you know I’ve … course I got a degree out of Hartford and all of these other universities, you know. So—so I’m … watch nature, that’s the best university that I’ve ever found yet, the Creator’s university. So if I watch that, I get my sermons from the way I see nature acting. And I said, “Well, that just makes me feel real good.” He said, “What’s the matter?” I said, “I just thought of something.” So, that day, I was preaching on that. And I said, “Now, you see, when the church first started out, it was … Jesus said … ” I was preaching John 15. “‘I am the Vine, ye are the branches. And every branch that don’t bring forth fruit will be cut off, burnt.’” And somebody just straddled my neck real hard on that, said, “You see, I thought if you was actually once filled with the Holy Ghost and saved, you said, ‘they couldn’t get away from it.’” “That’s right.” He said, “What about that?” I said, “Now you’re talking on a different subject. He’s talking about fruit-bearing there, not the Vine; He’s talking about fruitbearing, and not the Life. He said, ‘Well, just cut the tree back so it will grow, bear fruit.’” He said … And I said, “Now, see, this tree, when it started out, was all genuine, Bible Christians. Then along come a branch called Lutheran, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian: lemons and whatmore.” And I said, “You see, it thrives on the name of Christianity, but it … It’s living off of that Tree, but it’s bearing its own denominational kind. See? But” I said “if that orange tree ever puts out another limb itself, it’ll bear oranges like it did at the beginning.” There happened to been, setting up there, a head of a great … one of our greatest Pentecostal organizations. I don’t know how to make it so that everybody will understand that it isn’t my idea that—that I’m—I’m against those brethren, sisters; that is wrong. I’m so misunderstood, and I don’t know why. See? People think I don’t even believe in people going to church. That’s a million miles from the Truth. “We must assemble ourselves together, and that much more as we see the day approaching.” See? We must come together in unity. We might not … If I lived in a city and they had nothing there but a … well, some church (I don’t want to call any name), but just any church, if they only believed one thing, that Jesus was Divine, all the rest of it was wrong, I’d go to that church. If I can’t get a whole loaf of bread, I—I’ll take a slice. See? I’ll go listen, worship the Lord, and show Him that I’m doing my part. I want Him to know I’m alive. I’m—I’m … want everybody to know what side I’m on. I assemble with the Christians, and there worship and—and serve the Lord. But it’s so hard, I … used to bother me so bad, and then I found out even our Lord was misunderstood in so many things. He’d say anything, and they’d … be misunderstood. I guess it just has to be that way. But those who are wise will understand. See? The Bible said so. They’ll catch It. So this morning while saying this … And I said, “Now, they—they live off of the name of Christianity, but they bear the wrong kind of fruit. It has a denominational fruit. They set a thing, and they’re living right off of it, and living off the very Life.” It’s what I was trying to say last night, that spirit can be baptized into that Spirit and still not be a Christian. See? You’re living right off of the same Life, but the fruits you bear tells what you are. See? That’s right. See? They can do all the signs, and pray for the sick, and heal the sick, and open eyes, and cast out devils, and—and do all these things, living right off of the same Life that’s in there, but still it’s a lemon. See? That’s right. “The fruits, you’re known,” Jesus said. And so then we find out … And when I got off the platform, this great leader raised up, he said, “He didn’t mean that.” He said, “We know that we’re all grafted in.” Well, that is true that we are grafted, stump grafted, that’s right; but not in the Vine, grafted. So then he said … begin to kind of—kind of slur me back a little bit. And there was a young fellow there, I think it’s some movie star’s people. His name’s Danny Henry, and he was a Baptist boy. Well, he come to the platform to put his arms around me, and he said, “Brother Branham, I hope this don’t sound sacrilegious, but” said “I believe that could almost be the 23rd chapter of Revelation.” And I said, “Thank you.” And he started to say something else and he started speaking in tongues, a Baptist boy. And when he did, there was a—a woman from here in Louisiana, she was a Frenchman, kind of a big heavyset woman, she wrote down the interpretation. Well, then there was another young fellow setting over here was a Frenchman, he wrote down what he said. They compared the notes, and they both was the same. And then a big, light-headed boy standing way back in the back, at Clifton’s Cafeteria, come walking forth. He said, “Let me see those notes.” I want to see what they was, and all three of them was the same for the interpretation. He was the interpreter for the U.N., French interpreter. And it said this: Because thou has chosen this straight and narrow way, the harder way, you’ve done it at your own choosing. But what a glorious decision you’ve made, because it’s MY WAY. See? And said … and went ahead and said then: This in itself is that which will bring to pass, and make and bring, shall pass, the tremendous victory in the Love Divine. You see, always, even in French, the verb before the adverb there in the—in the—in the interpretation. So in that I couldn’t say … Moses, he made his choice, he had to make his choice. We all have to make our choices and do the best that we can. And God … I respect any man’s message that he’s given about God. I … whatever it is, I respect that with all my heart. Now, I see some young Brother come a while ago, Brother Stringer, I think from down in Louisiana … or Mississippi, brought us some pictures here that you seen us watching it. It was of the Angel of the Lord, when It appear. How many’s heard the story? I guess every one of you here’s heard it. You’ve had it on tape, and so forth. Now, that was told me one morning at ten o’clock, standing in my room in Indiana. Told me I would be at Tucson, be early in the morning, I’d be picking a cocklebur (what we call there, a goat-header) off of my trouser leg. And seven Angels came and bursted this, and ground bursted and everything else, to … rocks rolled out of the mountains, and seven Angels stood there. And I said, “Well … ” I told my wife, and she’s somewhere present this morning, “You get everything ready ’cause no way a man could exist that,” I said, “come out of that. I’m going to Tucson, my work is finished here on earth. I’m going Home to be with the Lord Jesus.” “Well,” she said, “are you sure?” I said, “Yes. Yeah, no one could—could stand that. There’s no way of doing it.” I just preached The Seven Church Ages. That’s where I had called our gallant, little Brother Jack Moore to ask him about this, Jesus, in Revelation 1, standing there with white hair and everything. I said, “He was a young Man.” And that’s where the revelation come about that being a wig on, and not Him; He’s wigged (and I couldn’t understand it), as being Supreme Deity. And the old judges used to in Israel, had to be white-headed. And the white stands for purity. And the English judges till this day, in supreme courts of England, put on a white wig when they come out, because there’s no other law above theirs on earth. See? And they’re supreme judge. And I remember I went there in Arizona and everything, I try my best to … Scared to death. I went to Phoenix meeting. And remember, I preached the sermon, Sirs, What Time Is It? Remember that? I said that I seen that, I said, “Before it comes to pass, remember, THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘Something’s going to happen.’” You’ve probably got the tapes in your library of tape now. And there I said, “You remember now the visions that never fails. ‘Something’s going to happen.’ Remember!” And a few days after that, I was getting nervous, and I thought, “What this? Am I going to die? If … I hope it’s quick so I can get over it. I don’t want to linger.” And one morning the Lord said, “Go up in the top of Sabino Canyon.” And I was up there holding up my hands, praying. I felt something strike my hand. It was a sword. Now, you can just imagine how you’d feel, standing there by yourself and here’s a knife in your hand about that long. I pulled it down and looked at it. It was just a knife, one of them … and I’m scared of a knife, anyhow. And it had a—it had a—a metal, something like one of these knifes, like pot metal or something, real sharp and narrow. Had a sheath around it here, where the dueler’s used to, to keep from cutting one another’s hands, and—and it had a pearl in the handle here. Just fit my hand exactly. Well, I rubbed my face and looked back. Right on that same spot, the other day, I saw a little, white dove come down. I’ll tell you about that later. And I was holding that in my hand, I thought, “That’s strange. Now, Lord, I … am I losing my mind? There’s no one here. I’m miles from anybody and here is a sword. I had my hand up, and where did it come from?” And I thought, “That’s the strangest thing. Now looky here, it’s a sword; see, hit it, and it was a sword.” And I said, “There’s nobody here standing here. I’m up on top of these rocks, plumb on top of the mountain.” And you couldn’t even see Tucson from there, it was so far down. I thought, “Now, that’s a strange thing. Now, it’s got to be in this vicinity somewhere, Somebody that could create and make a sword and put it in my hand.” I said, “It could only be the very God that created a ram for Abraham, could create those squirrels,” that you’ve heard. And I said, “Here is the material, three different kinds of material in it, and I’m holding it in my hand just as real as anything else I could hold in my hand.” And I heard a Voice, said, “That’s the King’s Sword!” And I thought, “Now, where did That come from? Was right along there in them rocks somewhere.” And I held up my hand like that, and I said, “A king’s sword.” And I looked around, and the sword was gone. And I said, “A king’s sword.” That’s to … they knight with—with a sword, I think that’s right, the army or some way, they knight with it, you know. And I said, “Well, that’s what that was probably for. It means that maybe I’m to lay hands upon ministers, or something like, that, to make them ministers.” And then I … A Voice spoke back again, said, “The King’s Sword!” Not a king; the King’s Sword! See? I thought, “Now, I’m either beside myself, my mind has slipped, or there’s something taking place, there’s somebody standing around here by me.” And brethren, these things are true. I don’t—I don’t know how to tell you, you’ve always seen it always happen that way. It’s true. See? And it’s … I couldn’t understand it. So … It’s the strangest feeling. And I stood there. I thought, “Now, ever Who that is that’s talked to me all my life, since a little, bitty baby boy, is standing right here, and I can’t see Him at all.” I said, “The King’s Sword?” That would be … God is the King. “And what is this sword?” “The Word, It’s been placed in your hand.” Said, “Don’t fear of death, it’s your ministry.” Oh, my! Down off that mountain I went; crying, screaming, top of my voice, jumping over rocks. I went down, told my wife, I said, “I’m not going to die, see, it’s—it’s—it’s my ministry.” (I told her to get with Billy Paul here, and take the children. I said, “Now, I don’t have anything, but the church will see that you all don’t go hungry and things, and I’ll—I’ll meet you across the border.”) And—and she … I said, “No, I’m not going to die, it’s something about my ministry.” A few days after that I was coming out from a meeting; had a three page telegram, was from over here at Houston, Texas. And that man that criticized me so bad the night that the Angel of the Lord was taken, the picture of It taken there at Houston, he called me up, he said … sent a telegram, the wife said, “I know, Brother Branham, you’re busy. My son, Ted Kipperman’s sister’s boy, is setting in the death row to die in the chair.” Said … (what if that was Billy Paul?). He said, “He and a little girl has got to die.” And you all read it in the paper, of course. And said, “Only hope we have is for you come and hold a meeting and get the people together.” And Raymond Hoekstra had already wrote me several times, but you know, I had planned after that meeting to go on a hunting trip with Mr. Mc Anally and them. And I thought, “Well, if I let them kids die and don’t put my effort forth, I’ll never be able to go hunting again.” So I said, “All right, I’ll come.” I come over to Houston, had the meeting, and course the … they never killed them, they just … they give them life. And that’s what they wanted them to do, just give them life. So that’s about twenty-one years, I guess, in—in Texas. So then, and going back, I went up in the mountain and I went with Brother Fred Sothmann. He’s here somewhere. Brother Fred, where you at? Right here. Brother Fred Sothmann, Brother Gene Norman; one day, the second day setting there, the Angel of the Lord came right down into the camp where we was at, and begin to tell about their children and things they were doing. I left and went back on the hill. And I had already got my javelina, and I was trying to chase one around to Brother Fred. So I found where they had been eating on the side of the hill, and I said, “Well, now, I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Brother Fred.” I said, “Now, you go over on that point in the morning.” We go up there at daylight, climb up over the mountain. “And go there at daylight, I’ll get over on the other side. Now, I won’t shoot one, but if they run this way, I’ll shoot in front of them and turn them back. You pick out a big one.” “All right,” he said. So Brother Fred went over there. And Brother Gene Norman (I don’t think Brother Gene come, did he? , he was—he was on the other side. Many of you know Gene Norman, a bosom friend to many, fine brother. And he went down a little below. Where, them pigs, they just wasn’t there that morning. And I could see Brother Fred, wave at him, he was about a mile away from me. Well, I thought, “Where could they have went?” I went down into a great ravine, and come down, I thought, “I’ll see if I can find where they’re at.” Started back up. It was just a little after daylight, the sun was just begin coming up. I went around a great big chasm, oh, my, hundreds and hundreds of feet, just great rocks in that great canyon there, them big walls. And it was kind of getting … the sun was raising up, about seven o’clock, I guess, or something like that. And I set down and I was looking around, I happened to look down on my trouser leg and there was that bull-header, burr. And I said, “You know, that seems strange. You know, the Angel of the Lord told me I’d be about forty miles northeast of Tucson, I’d be picking a bull-header off of my leg.” You remember it? Do you? Yes, sir. See? I said, “That’s strange.” I was holding it. And just as I looked up, I seen about twenty hogs about five hundred yards from me, come out eating this little phyllary and laid down. I said, “Now, if I can just get Brother Fred and get him around to that point there, he’ll get his hog right there. But I know he’s about a mile or two from me now. So,” I said, “if I could cross over this little ridge without them seeing me, up by this little juniper tree there,” I said, “if I get around this side, there’s a deer trail comes down this side, I can run up there and get out of the way. And hang a little piece of paper here where I know which one of the fingers to go out on, on the canyon, I can get Brother Fred there just in time.” I throwed this little bull-header down, forgetting about That. And started across the hill real easy and looked back, they didn’t see me, and run down and hit this deer trail. I had a great big black hat on. I started running up through this canyon real fast, and it happened. The whole earth shook, everywhere. Rocks that size rolled down, dust flying like that. And I looked, and standing before me stood seven Angels; just exactly the way it was. I felt like I was standing way up off the ground. First, I thought somebody had shot me, you know, with that black hat on; looked like a javelina hog, anyhow, you know they’re dark. I thought somebody had shot me, such a … right close. And I—I seen then what it was. Well, as soon as … I got my commission, and the Scripture, “The Seven Seals which is the seven mysteries.” See? Someone said to me, said, “Now … ” Oh, he said, “Well, now, someday the Lord probably (you seeing visions, Brother Branham) will reveal to you what these things are, we can all get closer to God and have more power than we get in speaking in tongues and things.” I said, “It can’t be that way.” Cause, see, I believe the Word to be the Truth. And the Bible said, “Whosoever shall add one word or take one Word from It.” It has to be in this Word. See? It’s the mysteries that the people has overlooked, for right there is where come my Message of Serpent’s Seed and the true Belief of the security of the believer. I’m not disgrading my Presbyterian brethren there, and some of you Baptist brethren on the way you have security. I’m not saying this to be different, but you didn’t have it just right. See? That’s right. See? But, I had it wrong, too. But when an Angel stands from Heaven and tells you, and here it is right in the Scripture, That’s true. See? That’s right. See, He always speaks exact with the Scripture. In there I watched it until that circle went up, started sweeping up, and they turned into like a mystic light, like a fog. Just exactly the way … How many seen the picture of It that was taken in Houston? Nearly all. See? Well, that’s just the way this was. It turned into the same thing, It kept going higher and higher. I was running and running, trying to find Brother Fred and them. After while, about a half hour later, I could see him way down, waving his hands; and Brother Gene coming, waving. They knowed something had happened. And so then I got with them. That’s Brother Fred setting right there. As it went up, I didn’t know that the observatories and things, plumb into Mexico, was taking that picture. Life magazine packed it as It went up. And many of you … Here’s Life magazine packing the picture of It. A mysterious thing here, and they said they don’t know where it come from; it’s too high. It’s above all the spheres and everything else to be … It’s too high for fog, because it’s thirty miles high and twenty-seven miles across after it got up that high. There’s not even humidity or nothing up there, you see. And they thought of a plane; so they checked all the places, no planes up that day. See, they have to, on account of shaking windows and things. “There’s no planes up.” Here it is right here in the magazine, will tell you the same thing. And—and it went on and on. And today right in the … Here it is in Science magazine, where, they can’t understand. They don’t know what It is. Tucson, at the university, a friend of mine went over the other day and was talking to them about it. Said, “We can’t understand what … ” I said, “Don’t say nothing, won’t do no good. ‘Cast not your pearls before swine.’” See? It’s to the Church, to the Elected, the called-out. See? And then each one was coming, saying, “Brother Branham, I see your picture here. I see this. I … ” You know how it is. But that—that long sweep as this brother has on here where it … 82.6.n Excuse me. [Brother Branham gets the photograph — Ed.] Here’s the way It started up, sweeping up. Actually this was on the right hand side. And you all remember I said, “The noted Angel was the one that talked to me, was on the right hand side,” even before it happened. You remember? His wings pointed back like that. That’s exactly the wings of that Angel as it went up. See, as it … So they started taking the pictures because it was so mysterious. But when the last picture, when It formed Itself into the skies and so forth, this is it as Look here packed it. You see how it goes up just as they begin to see it, you see. And there comes the—the real main and last picture, when it formed. They don’t know where it come from or where it went, they don’t know yet. Science is completely stumped about it, don’t know what happened. But we know; “there shall be signs in the heaven above.” We know it. See? And He promised these things. See? And the only thing that this was permitted to be taken … Now, I know we’re just home folks here this morning. If I ever impress you brethren or sisters as a know-it-all, please forgive me. I don’t mean to be that. I’m stand … setting here this morning talking before men who are scholars, men who are smart; I—I’m a illiterate, I can’t even pronounce my Scriptures right. I got a chapter to read this morning, I’m … was going to ask one of the brothers here to read it for me, ’cause I can’t even pronounce the names in it, First Chronicles 13, (if you will, Brother Jack, you can be hunting it up), for my subject. I—I can’t even pronounce those names, I’m letting him do it, ’cause he can pronounce them. And I know I’m talking to smart men. But, brethren, these things are done that you might not look at my illiteracy, but believe that I’m telling you the Truth. It’s God telling you the Truth. That’s the Truth. See? Now, and when I speak of denominations, I’m not meaning for you to be so cruel and … No, I don’t mean for you not to go to your church. Go to your church, what you’re supposed to do. But just don’t join up with them organizations, because one day I’ll be telling you and prove it by the Scripture, it is the mark of the beast. And you just remember, it’s the mark. I’m preaching … I wouldn’t preach it in Brother Jack’s church, he’d tell me, “Go ahead and do it”; but I’m going to the tabernacle, it’ll be about four hours long. And my subject is, “The beast at the beginning and the beast at the end, through the trail of a serpent.” See? Takes about four hours. I got my Scriptures all laying out. The beast from the beginning, he was the beast at the garden of Eden, he’s the beast at the end, and show that he’s a religious person and a denomination (that made the denomination); and come right through the trail of it, and prove it to you by the Scriptures that it is. I didn’t know that till the Holy Spirit give it to me the other day up there. Now, in this, I was watching this one day, standing, and something said to me … looking at it, and I thought … Brother Hickerson, one of my trustees … or deacons at the church at Jeffersonville … If I don’t believe in going to church, why do I have church? We had them all across the country, hooked up the other night, every two hundred square miles had one of my churches. Now, this—this picture, I was standing, looking at it, and something … I was standing in my room. Something said, “Turn it to the right.” I listened. I know that sounds like somebody that’s a little mentally upset, but, you see, as I said the other night, all these great things are so scholarly … Now, I’m not against that. Remember, we have to send your children to school and get education and so forth, but I’ll tell you right now, it won’t do them no good in the world that is to come, ’cause it’d be another civilization, all way so far above this. That civilization won’t even have any … It won’t have any schools in it, it won’t have any death in it, won’t be any sin in it. This has all that; no matter how much civilized we get, more and more death is added all the time. See? That one will be without death. But now we have to have school, we have to wear clothes, we … I was going to speak this morning on Satan’s Eden (many of you’s got the tape of it), Satan’s Eden. He has made another garden of Eden, and six thousand years it’s taken him to make it, just like God did His at the beginning. God made His Eden, and Satan corrupted it. Now Satan’s made his own Eden, and God’s going to destroy it (that’s right) and put His Own. Something said to me, “Turn it right.” I thought, “I think I’m looking at it right.” Said, “Turn it right.” See? I thought, “Maybe that Voice means turn it to the right.” And when I did, you see what it is: Hofmann’s Head of Christ, at thirty-three. Here, look in here, see His black beard, His face, His eyes, His nose, and everything else. See the part in His hair here coming up. And He’s wigged with that white Angel wig to show that the Message of Him being God is the Truth. He is the Supreme Judge of the universe, Supreme Judge of Heaven and earth. He is God, and nothing else but God. He is God expressed in human form called the Son of God, which the Son was the mask. And if that don’t make our Message exactly right: identified by the Scripture, identified in service, identified by His Presence, the same yesterday, today, and forever. Therefore those Seven Seals are the Truth, brethren. Might disagree with them, but just set down and study it with your open heart one time, just let the Holy Spirit lead you from … Here, when Brother Jack … I called him before preaching this and talked to him one time about “What was this white wig?” He said, “Well, Brother Branham, I declare it to be that it was in His … after His resurrection in His glorified body.” I was talking to Brother Jack. And there’s … I don’t know of anybody in the world that I’d rely on anymore of their teachings on theology and things as I would like Brother Jack Moore and Brother Vayle, and such men as—as that, real theologians that’s read all kinds of books and different angles from everything. Well, but, you see, even with that, and my bosom friend, I—I—I just couldn’t receive it, there was something there just wouldn’t take it. And then when it come, this, then I see what it is. Here’s His dark beard. You see It, I guess. See? His dark beard and dark hair, His eyes, nose, everything, just perfectly, and even the part in His hair coming over on this side. He is God! See? And He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever. And this is Look magazine … or Life magazine. I think this is the … I forget what issue it is now; oh, May the seventeenth, 1963. That’s when it come out, if anybody wants the magazine. It’s the same picture that’s got Rockefeller and his—his wife on the back of it. And this is the new Science magazine that “it’s still a mystery.” What did I say these things for? That it might give you a little view of the things that we’re trying to say, that God is identifying both in heavens and in earth to be right, these discernments, visions. We have plenty of impersonations, we always. But remember, before there can be a bogus dollar, there has to be a real dollar first; first has to be a real dollar, and then they’re made off of that. Just like we had a real Moses and a real Aaron, then we had a Jambres and Jannes after them. You see how it all comes? They see it and then they try to impersonate that, when there’s truly one original. That’s right. Not saying that to harm or to degrade, or misplace something, but just for Truth; to know that I … I’m getting to be an old man, and I know my time ain’t too long. If Jesus, tarries, I may … could stay a little while; but I know that someday this heart’s going to make its last beat, and I’m entering into a great, dark chamber there called death. But when that comes, I don’t want anything to have to look back for, to try to repent for. I want, when I come to that time, to be clean and pure by the grace of God. I want to wrap myself in the robes of His righteousness, when I enter there, with this one thing in my mind: I know Him in the power of His resurrection; and when He calls, I’ll come out from among the dead and live with Him forever. And it’s my purpose here now to try to get every man … not to change your theologies or nothing, but to increase your faith in God’s promise of this day. Now let us pray: Dear God, we are a grateful people this morning, but yet, Lord, we’re living in a dark world that … There isn’t a one of us here this morning, Father, but what feels that we—we want a closer walk with You, we want that—that touch of You in our lives that can tender us and make us flexible so that You can change us at anytime, mold us into sons and daughters of God. That—that’s our purpose here, Father, that’s—that’s my only objective that I have is to try to—to live before You and to get Your Word and speak It back to the men and women that … not to be a different person but to try to honor Him who has give me Life. Grant it, Lord. May there not be a person here today … Or—or if … We’re hooked up this morning, across the nation, again. May there not be a person that’s in the sound of our voice ever have to go into that great chamber not knowing You in the power of Your resurrection. If there be sinners somewhere across the country, that … or in this building, this great auditorium, setting here this morning. If there are those who don’t know You, may this be the day that their conscience will be shook, woke up, and they’ll realize that they don’t know what minute that we may be called or summoned to answer for our lives, on High. And if our name is still on that stalk book, doomed we’ll be; but if it’s in the Lamb’s Book of Life, the real Life, then we are saved. And may, Lord, as that Life travels from the blade into the pollen, into the shuck, then to the grain, while we’re passing through this morning if there be some Life that goes into the grain that’s laying back in that stalk, bring it out today, Lord, may it follow the moving of the grain, for we ask it in Jesus’ Name. Amen. Sorry to take so much time. I had forgot about this even being on radio time out there, the phone time. Now let us turn for our reading. And Brother Jack, have you got your Bible there? While I’m finding my Scripture, I’ll ask Brother Jack to read this Scripture because I cannot pronounce these names. All right. It’s in First Chronicles 13. [Brother Jack Moore says, “The whole chapter?” — Ed.] Uh-huh. [Brother Jack Moore reads First Chronicles 13:1-14: And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: And let us bring again the Ark of our God to us: for we—we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim. And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it. And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave—drave the cart. And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. And when they came to the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, and because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before the Lord. And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place was called Perez-uzza to this day. And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me? So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed— Obed-edom in the house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had — Ed.] Thank you, Brother Moore, for the reading of the Scripture for me. Now, sorry I couldn’t read that myself, but I—I couldn’t do it. Now I want you to turn with me to Mark 7:7, and we’ll read the first seven verses of Saint Mark the 7th chapter. Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. And when he saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed hands, they found fault. But the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands … eat oft not, holding—holding the traditions of the elders. And when they came forth from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things were—were they … which they have received of the … received to hold, … the washing of the cups, and of pots, and brass vessels, and of tables. Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hand? He answered and said unto them, Well has Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. Let us pray. Dear God, honor Your Word now, and may It accomplish that which It is purposed for. Use us as instruments to speak It, and our ears to hear from You, and our hearts to receive It. We ask in Jesus’ Name, for the glory of God. Amen. Now, my subject for a few moments is this … I … We are on the national telephone hookup this morning. And I understand that my good friend, Roy Borders, is listening in, pretty well tore up about last night. I’d forgot that we were on the radio … or this hookup last night. Roy, wherever you are, if you’re over in San Jose in the church there, or either down to Brother McHughes’ church, or wherever you are, don’t fear, my brother, everything will be all right. Set still, you just … He’ll make it known to me, Roy; don’t worry, son, have faith in God. My subject this morning is: Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God’s Will. Now, that’s a strange text, and I trust that the Lord will reveal this to us now. Remember, “Trying to do God a service without it being the will of God.” Now, that seems very strange. But, in this, maybe God can help us. Another thing I’d like to say this morning, that we’re glad to have in our midst a friend of mine, a very dear friend, a young fellow. Many of you people on the radio now can … or the … on the telephone hookup, knows who this is. Today is his birthday, ninety-three years old, Brother Bill Dauch setting here before me, ninety-three years old. Several years ago the doctor said, “He cannot live.” I just noticed him setting here now. Under oxygen tent, and his lovely wife called me and said, “Brother Branham, if you expect to see your old friend, Bill, alive, you better come at once.” And I … One of my tires was cut on the side, my wheel had been knocked out, and I tore a tire off of my car trying to get to him. I was just coming from a—a—a station, filling station, and coming from the restroom where I had stopped in Ohio trying to get to him, and walking out I saw a vision. And there stood Brother Dauch, standing in the church with his hand out; it changed, and I see you coming down the street and shook my hand. Said, “Go tell him, ‘THUS SAITH THE LORD.’” He was about ninety years old then. He had a heart attack with a heart block, and a complete heart failure. Very shrewd doctor. The man is not … he don’t want … No, I won’t say that. He’s just a man that can afford … get any doctor he’d want. He had a very fine Jewish doctor who met me in the hall and said, “There’s not a chance for him to live.” And I went in and slipped my hand under the oxygen tent, I said, “Bill, can you hear me?” He nodded his head. I said, “THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘You’re not going to die now.’” A week from then, when I got in the pulpit to preach my Message, here come Brother Dauch walking up through the building. And when I went over to Furr’s Restaurant, across … I mean the Blue Boar, across in Louisville, here he was getting out of the car, coming down the street, holding his hand out; just exactly according to the Word of the Lord. And that’s three or four years ago; and here he sets all the way down here, in Shreveport (crosses the nation, not by plane now, by car) uh-huh, setting here this morning. “Happy birthday, Brother Dauch.” That’s from all across the nation, from everywhere. “God bless you!” I baptized him, after being a trinitarian, I baptized him when he … was one of my first meetings, when Brother Banks Wood had to let him have his clothes (he’s a good-size man, as you see), and he went into the pool and I baptized him at about eighty-five or ninety years old, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. He said he never could feel right until he found that security of something. Then he received a birth-day where he’ll never grow old. That’s right, that great Land. He even is expecting to live to see the Coming of the Lord; it can be done. But if he would sleep, he … and we are awake at that time, he’ll come first. Right. So, Brother Dauch, there’s no way now to miss it. You’re exactly on the line. Stay there, my brother, and God bless you. And I thank the Lord for a good man like that, and for giving him all of these years. In the Book of the Chronicles, “Trying to do God a service without it being His will.” God is sovereign, first, we want to understand that. The people today are wondering why we can’t have a revival. Do you believe God’s sovereign? See, the Bible speaks this way. And we try … As I was discussing with a group of my fine brothers, Baptist brethren, not long ago, and they said, “Brother Branham, we can only have a revival when we take the Word, word by word, page by page, letter by letter.” And I said, “I believe too, page by page.” He said … I said, “They’ve been trying to do that all along.” He said, “But we must find the Greek interpretation of the Word, what the Greek says.” I said, “I haven’t read too much, but reading the history of the church, and the Nicaea Council, and the Pre-Nicaea Council, and Nicaea fathers, so forth, they were arguing back there about the Greek. That’s two thousand years ago. One said, ‘It means this,’ and one says, ‘It means that. The Greek word means this.’” Just like our language; the word see. Use the word see, you could mean “a body of water, I understand,” or many things. Bored, “to be bored, a hole, make a walk,” or—or “you bored me,” or “you paid my board,” or it could mean any … many things. And those little vowels, and so forth, just change the whole meaning. So you’ll never do it like that. God wrote It like that, because … And all of the Word is inspired, and He said that, “I thank Thee, Father, Thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and will reveal” (amen) “to babes such as will learn.” It’s a revelation of Him, as I said last evening, “Will reveal It to babes.” I said, “It won’t work, sir.” I said, “A revival will never come until God, the sovereign God, sends it; and then He might take up a little nitwit that can’t even sign his name, and do it with it, that knows not even good English let alone the Greek.” That’s what He done in the time when Peter preached at Pentecost, you know, he couldn’t even sign his name, ignorant and unlearned. But God does things in such strange way to our intellectual thinking. That makes it God. If He’d got a bunch of theologians and dignitaries, and so forth, they’d said, “That smart Caiaphas, you see, he had it just right.” But God went down and got fishermen that couldn’t even sign their name, and that’s what He took. That’s God, He takes something that’s nothing and makes something out of it to His Own honor. He took a chaos and made a Eden. Uh-huh, it’s God. Now, if there’s anybody got the mechanics for a revival, is our noble brother, Billy Graham. But the mechanics is all right, but the mechanics won’t move it, it takes the dynamics to move it. You can build an automobile, put fine seats in it, make fine pistons and—and prove by science what it can do; but unless the dynamics is there, she’s just a dead piece of goods. So, in the Welsh revival, one of our late revivals before our Pentecostal, no one knowed what started the revival, just a bunch of people. Now, when we get all … our friend, Billy Graham, will get all of the Presbyterians, and Lutherans, and Pentecostals, and everything together, go into the city and there they’ll have a great gathering together of thousands, and thirty thousand will come (in two weeks) and give their hearts to Christ; go back another two weeks and you ain’t got a one. See, that’s the mechanics. But let God in His sovereign grace just speak to some little nitwit, as so to say, a little nobody; let His Spirit fall into the city and men can’t go to work, women can’t wash dishes, the maid can’t make the bed, screaming and crying with their hands up in the air. That’s revival, that’s in the will of God. It was said that some noblemen from the church went over to the Wales to understand, or figure out what all the mechanics was in the revival, during the Welsh revival. And when they got off the ship with their tall hats on, and their round collar; seeing, coming down the street, a little policeman, swinging his club around and around like that, whistling; they said, “My good man, could you tell me where the Welsh revival is?” He said, “Yes, my brethren, you’re standing in the middle of it!” Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. He said, “You understand, I am the Welsh revival,” said, “because the Welsh revival’s in me.” That’s sovereign! That’s what God does, and He alone has a right to send a revival. Not get the mechanics together, it’s pray for God to send the dynamic—dynamic. He only reveals His Word in the predestinated. Now, when I use the word predestinate … Now, it’s a bad word to use in public, especially when we have mixed crowds between the Arminians and the Calvinists. And not a … I’ve asked you not to think I know It all, but they’re both wrong according to the Scripture. Grace is what God did for me, works is what I do for Him. See? Then you’ve got It. If you climb out on either one of the limbs, you’ll sure find yourself out on the end of the limb and can’t get back. The Book of Ephesians pulls it together, I think. Now, but the word, when I use it, predestinated, don’t think that I’m … that’s the only word I know how to—to make … It’s God’s foreknowledge, see, that He knowed. He—He can’t say … He—He died that all might be saved, He did, but by His foreknowledge He knowed who would and who would not. See? That’s what He knows, I don’t know it and you don’t know it, so we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Now, but God has His Word set, and has in all ages. His foreknowledge has caused Him to set in the church, and in the people, certain things that He did from the beginning. And then the Gospel that’s being preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people, the rest of them don’t see It. See? “Thank Thee, Father Thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and reveal It to babes such as would learn.” See, that’s predestination. Not that He did it by, you say, “I’ll choose you, and don’t choose you.” By His foreknowledge, He knowed what you would do. By Him being infinite … Do you believe He’s infinite? If He isn’t, He can’t be God. Then, you think, being infinite: He knew every flea that would ever be on the earth, how many times them fleas would bat their eyes, how much tallow was in each flea, every blade of grass it would ever set on; that’s infinite. And we are finite, we stumble in darkness. God likened us to sheep, and we must have a Leader. And that Leader is not man, that Leader is the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Christ among us. “A little while and the world seeth Me no more.” His physical being was raised up to the Throne of God, where the Spirit was on the Throne; now Christ is on the Throne, Jesus. “A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see Me, for I’ll be with you to the end of the world, even in you.” The Throne of God, of Christ, is erected into your heart; and He’s setting on God’s Throne, but in the Millennium He sets on His Own Throne; which, He swore that He’d raise up this Man, His Son, David’s Son, to set on His Throne. Now, He reveals these things by His foreknowledge to those who He has ordained to these things, otherwise they don’t see It. Stand right there, looking right at It, and can’t see It. How many ever seen that picture of a cow in the bush, that you just have to look and look? Did you ever see that? Or, seen the picture of Christ in a bush, or in the sky, or clouds? See, that painter has got that so fixed up till you have to look at it just a certain way. Well, then, when you once see it, you can’t see nothing else but that. Every time you look, there it is. How many’s seen those pictures? Well, sure you have. Well, that’s the way Christ is, Himself, the Gospel, the Message is. When you once see the Message of the hour, there’s nothing else you can see but That. That’s all. Everything else is gone, the rest of it’s just a filler, see, see, when you once see the Message! That’s—was in Noah’s time. When Noah and his group … see how … When they saw the Message, nothing else mattered. When Moses’ group saw It, nothing else mattered. When John’s group saw It, nothing else mattered. When Jesus’ group saw It, nothing else mattered. When the apostles’ group saw It, nothing else mattered. When Luther’s group saw It, Wesley’s group saw It, Pentecostal group saw It, nothing else mattered, they pulled away from everything. Why? By His foreknowledge He predestinated these things to happen. He chooses His Own person by His foreknowledge. Like He said in Romans 8 here, that Esau … that the—that the election of God might stand sure. That Esau and Jacob both borned of holy parents, twins, that His election might stand sure and true, He said, “I hate Esau, and love Jacob,” before either boy was borned. See? He knows what’s in man, He knowed it from the beginning what it was, therefore He can make everything work just exactly on clock time. We get all nervous and flusterated; you never seen Him flusterated, they don’t. See? Everything’s working all right, just exactly, the clock’s ticking. These things that’s supposed to happen, all these women with short hair, and these men wearing their … like they got hair like their wives. I see them, absolutely, have these roller-curlers in their hair, curl it up here in front. What a perversion! That’s the results of Satan’s Eden. And do like her: she is trying to cut her hair like her husband; her husband’s letting his hair grow like his wife. And she is wearing his clothes, and he’s wearing her underneath clothes. See, there you are. She’s getting masculine, and he’s getting feminish. See, it’s Satan’s Eden, contrary to what God made it at the beginning. That’s the Truth. If I don’t get started, we’ll never get into this. But these things, and the way for Him to do it, and who will do it, that’s His Own chosen way, He chooses. That’s the way He wants it done. As I heard Brother Pearry Green, our pastor at Tucson, preaching the other night about how that God made things some way (I forget what his text was), but he said, “That’s the way God likes it, that’s the way God does it.” Well, that’s right. Now, who is it among us that’s going to tell Him, “He’s wrong”? Who would dare to stand up in God’s face, and say, “You’re wrong, Lord, You should do it the way I want it done, the way Dr. So-and-so said it should be done”? Who is that far gone in their mental faculties, to say a thing like that? No, you wouldn’t come out and say it, but you think it! Like on my Message of the Antichrist, “There shall rise false christs.” Now, He didn’t say false Jesuses. See, nobody would stand still to be called “Jesus,” in the term of the Lord. But false christs means “the anointed.” Oh, they, each one thinks they got anointing, “Glory to God, he can do this and do that!” But put him on the Word test and find what he comes out at, see, the Message of the hour. They had anointing in the time of Jesus, but not on Him. They had anointing in time … Even Dathan had anointing in the time of Moses. He said, “Now, don’t you think you’re the only holy one among us, God’s got plenty. We’ll just start an organization here, a group of men.” God said to Moses, “Separate yourself from him,” and He opened up the earth and swallowed them up. He had give His original Word to Moses, His prophet; that’s the only way He ever did do it, and the only way He ever will do it. He doesn’t change His plan, see. So our ideas is wrong, His ideas are right, always. And don’t try to tell Him that He’s “wrong.” No matter who we think is best qualified, it isn’t us to say who is best qualified. Now, there is where you get in the organization. Some little brother filled with the Spirit will go into a city and build up an organi- … build up a—a nice group of people, and at the conference they’ll meet, and all the holy brethren get along, you know, and say, “You know what? I believe little Jones here,” (he’s just a little pick among them) “I think he ought to have that nice big tabernacle, I think. Don’t you think that’s right?” No, my. There he goes. And then the congregation’s scattered. See? Separate these! God does the separating, He’s the One Who does it. But they all, each one, wants to take this little one, put him over here, and this one down here. That’s man’s idea. Man has the keys, but God holds the keys actually. They give the disciples, the holy church, the keys; and watch the first time they used it, when Judas had fell by transgression. They got together and cast lots; and the holy brethren. Who would say they wasn’t holy brethren? Who say they wasn’t holy? But they cast lots, and it fell on Matthias. And when he … What did he ever do? Nothing. But Paul was the elected one! Amen. That was God’s choosing: a little, hook-nosed, sarcastic, high-tempered Jew. Not the Matthias, the D.D., you know, he—he was … It’s Paul. God chose Paul; the church choose, chose Matthias. See? You have no right to tell God He’s “wrong.” He knows what to do, He knows what the man’s made out of. Who would ever … That church ever chose Paul? Oh, no, never. Said, “That guy’s the one that’s putting us all in jail.” But God said, “I’ll show him what he’ll suffer for Me.” He know what. All right, no matter who we think is right, God knows who’s best qualified because He knows the heart of man, He knows. Nor does the revival, or does these things, happen at the time that we think they ought to happen. We think, “It’s this time right now, glory to God!” I notice in our chapters and so forth of the Business Men, “There’s coming right away, hallelujah, a great revival!” Don’t be deceived, “He has already come, and they did to him what was list.” See? But they think there’s a revival. Is it happening? No! It’s done, and dead, it’s over. Uh-huh. Notice, this is lamp-trimming time, coming out and going in. “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.” Notice here in our text, notice David, king of Israel, he was the one who got the revelation of bringing the ark of God back to his place; that, they never consulted it in the days of Saul ’cause Saul had backslid. So they never consulted the ark at all, the covenant, in the days of Saul, ’cause he had backslid and got away from God. So David, quickly, with inspiration … Now notice this, it’s a very treacherous text if you don’t get it right. And I feel that the hour is coming where we should be men instead of babies. Uh-huh. We should have strong meat instead of milk. Notice David, king of Israel, the king had just been freshly anointed the king; or elected king, Saul … Samuel anointed him by the will of God; and he was absolutely God’s chosen king, no doubt to it. And here he is, and inspiration strikes him. It was revealed to David. He got the revelation, nobody else had said nothing about it. “Let us go and fetch the ark, ’cause that’s the will of God that we have the ark here with us, that we consult God by this ark.” Very, very gallant thing. Don’t you think so? All right. Remember, but, him being king, and got the revelation, he overstepped his place. There was a prophet in the land by the name of Nathan, he was the one that was ordained to get the revelation. There’s anything to be spoke, He said, “The Lord doeth nothing until He reveals it to His servants the prophet.” But, you see, David being king, with the anointing upon him … Now, is that the Scripture? Anointing upon him, and got a true revelation; but it was wrong: Because Nathan was the prophet of that age; and the revelation never come to Nathan; and when the revelation come to David, he never even consulted Nathan about it. He’s just going to go ahead and do what he wanted to do. Uh-huh. But notice who David consulted here in the 13th chapter, “But he consulted the captains of thousands and of hundreds,” back to his congregation. See? “Now, don’t you think we should do … ?” That isn’t it. Now, he was trying to do God a service, but he wasn’t ordained to do it; see, ’cause God had a way. Just the same as God could have spoke to the—the king about his sore and getting well, but He didn’t, He had a ordained way of doing it, that was His prophet. So He spoke to the prophet, Isaiah, told him to go back and tell Hezekiah what would happen. Now, Hezekiah was talking face to face with God, and—and God could talk to Hezekiah, of course, but He made certain channels! You understand it? God has His Own set way of doing things: sending revivals, talking, speaking, whatever it is. He has His way of doing it, and we are nobody to tell Him how to do it. He does it the way it pleases Him to do it. So, you see, David, being inspired … Now, you remember I said the, anointing, the false anointing? Remember the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a person, and still it’s out of the will of God. Here, It proves it right here. See? We have to go through God’s way of doing it, not our ways, God’s way of doing it. Cause, David, being a king, anointed, anointed with the Spirit of God upon him (a type of Jesus Christ), but that wasn’t God’s channel. When all the congregation, “it pleased them,” the Bible said. Notice, captains of thousands and of hundreds, also the priests and theologians thought that was “wonderful.” There is your Bible schools and everything else, they thought it was “wonderful.” Even all of the people agreed, and the priests, and—and all of them agreed that the king’s anointing was right. Notice! But God had not promised to reveal His Word in Its season to them. God had His way of revealing His Word, but not to them. Remember, it was contrary to God. Something like in the days of Micaiah the son of Imla. Do you remember that story? Judah and Israel were separated, and they had two different kingdoms, and Ahab was the king over one kingdom. And Jehoshaphat was over the king—kingdom of Judah, I believe it was; and Ahab was over Israel, Jerusalem. Notice, and then here come in a bunch of alien and took off part of the God-given land that God had give to Israel, and these Philistines up there, or Syrians, were holding that ground and were feeding their own children off of the ground that belonged to Israel. And so they needed that ground to feed their own children and their own families. God gave them … That was their God-given rights. And so Ahab calls down Jehoshaphat, and said, “Come down.” He said, “Looky there what our enemy’s doing. Is it right that we, the people of God, with a God-given right that we should have this land, it belongs to us, God through His prophet, Joshua, divided this land, it should be ours; it belongs to us, to our children, and here the communists has took it over, and we have … We’re so hungry, and they have got our God-given rights. Don’t you think that we should go up there and take our land back? If you’ll join your forces: if you Methodists, and Presbyterians, and all, and Presbyterians, and Lutheran, and so forth, all take the ecumenical council here now, we’ll all set together, and we’ll take the thing.” (I’m saying and speaking in a parable now.) “We’ll go get it.” “Why,” he said, “certainly, we’re all one.” Uh-huh. Now, the Bible said, “How can two walk together except they be agreed?” See? There where that great man, that great Pentecostal man, Jehoshaphat, got mixed up with the wrong crowd. And that’s what happened to our Pentecostals today. There’s some real men in there, but they’re mixed up in that denominational crowd. Get out of that thing! It’s cursed of the Lord! Notice now! There he was, and he said, “Yes, that sounds reasonable.” Said, “Our chariots is yours; our people. After all, we’re all Jews. Sure, we’ll go up with you.” But is just enough religion left in Jehoshaphat to say, “Don’t you think we—we should consult the Lord first?” See? “I think it’d be a good idea.” Why, Ahab, “Of course.” Said, “Why, oh, sure, I should have thought of that.” “Well, is there a man of God somewhere? Have you got a prophet?” “Ah, I got four hundred of them. I got the whole council down here, the whole denomination. They’re Hebrew prophets.” Now remember, the Bible said they were “prophets, Hebrew prophets,” not heathen prophets, Hebrew prophets; a school of them, a theological seminary. “Well, bring them up!” And the kings dressed themselves and set before him to impress the prophet. And here come, I believe it was Zedekiah come up, the great chief of the district councilmen, or ever what he was, come up there among them. He made hisself two big horns, he said, “I have heard from God. THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘With these horns you’ll push the Syrians plumb out of the land.’” “O glory!” everybody thought that was wonderful, fine. Watch how close it gets to that razor edge now, between right and wrong. And remember it’ll fall on one or the other sides, till it comes down sometime like a honed razor between the difference of right and wrong. It’s got to be every Word of God; not just almost every Word, but every Word! And it’s got down today, not to Lutherans, not to Methodists, not to Pentecostals, but to that honed age, in this age where the antichrist anointing is so perfectly, it would deceive the very Elected, they’ll fall on the wrong side if they don’t watch it, like a wedge. Watch! Be careful! We’re not living in a Pentecostal age now. We’re passed that age, just the same as we was passed Lutheran, and passed … See? Notice. Now the prophets all prophesied, four hundred of them, well fed, well fixed, Hebrew prophets gave them witness, one accord, “THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘Go up, the Lord is with you.’” Jehoshaphat said, “Well, that—that sounds all right. But,” said, “have you got another one?” “Another one? We got the whole denomination here, we got the whole council gathered out here. Why do we need another one?” He said, “Ah,” said, “I thought maybe there might be another one.” He said, “Oh, yes, there is another one, but he don’t even belong to this council.” Uh-huh. “He’s an outcast. It’s Micaiah, the son of Imla, and I hate him.” See? Said, “They won’t receive him in the fellowship, and he’s just a common outcast to begin with. And he’s constantly, everything he prophesies, he just won’t encourage my seminary a bit.” Uh-huh. “And he does all these things evil, he’s always prophesying evil against me, just to be different.” “Oh,” Jehoshaphat said, “don’t let the king say such a thing as that. But I’d like to hear what this man’s got to say.” Said, “Well, we’ll find him.” So they sent out somewhere in the wilderness, and they sent a man. Said, told him, said, “Now, on your road back now, I want to tell you something. Do you want to get back in the denomination again?” See? “Do you want to have fellowship with all of them again? If you do, say the same thing the district presbyter says, say the same thing the bishop says, and they’ll bring you right back. Now is the time to do it.” But could you imagine a anointed, true prophet of God compromising on one Word of God? No indeedy! He said, “As the Lord lives, I’ll only say what God says!” We need a son of Imla. “As the Lord lives, I’ll only say what He says.” That’s right, “What He says.” So when they got down there before the people, all the prophets, they said, “Now, you say they … ” He said, “Wait, give me tonight, let me see what the Lord’s going to say.” So, that night, the Lord appeared to him in a vision and told him what to say. The next morning he said, “What do you say, Imla?” when they was all standing out … I mean “Micaiah, son of Imla,” said, “what do you say now? We’re all here together, all of the priests, and all of the prophets, and all of the kings, and everything setting here together. What do you say now at this great council?” Said, “Go on up,” said, “but I seen Israel scattered like sheep having no shepherd.” And Ahab said, “What did I tell you! That renegade can only prophesy evil against me!” How could he say anything else when God was saying the same thing? A prophet’s supposed to be the mouth of God speaking, not his own thinking. His … You see, he’s com- … so completely yielded to God, he don’t want to hurt nothing, but he has to say what God says, ’cause he has no control of It hisself. See? He said, “Now, didn’t I tell you?” And then up come the—the big man with the horn, and smacked him in the mouth, he said, “Which way went the Spirit of God when It went out of me?” In other words, let me try to break that down, “Looky here in … Looky here, I want to tell you something, Micaiah. Do you realize that I am a master in the Scripture? Do you realize that I have the anointing?” Or, “the Baptism,” we’d say it today. “Do you realize that I have that?” Imla said, “I’m not doubting that.” He said, “But listen! The Spirit of God has told me, and bore witness with all my four hundred here, that we’re ‘going to push the Syrians out of the land.’ And who are you to come around and say that our great king is going to be slain?” He said, “The Spirit of God told me that.” Let me just break it down so you’ll understand it. And maybe we find Micaiah say, “Last night in the vision, sir, I saw God setting upon a Throne. And I saw all the host of Heaven gathered around Him, uh-huh, and they were having a council in Heaven. They said, ‘Who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab? Because under the Throne here is a prophet, a true prophet, his name is Elijah. And he has prophesied by My Word and said that “That wicked Ahab, because he slew Naboth, the dogs will lick the blood of that wicked man,” and we’ve got to make That come to pass because It’s already been spoken, It’s THUS SAITH THE LORD! It has to come to pass, got to be there. And how are we going to do it?’” “Then down from the creeping regions of the lost, way down in there come a spirit moving up, he said, ‘I’m a deceiver, and if I can do a service to You, I’ll go down and get in his prophet.’” Because they was so organized, they’ll only understand one thing, and that’s a little emotions. “‘And I’ll cause them to prophesy a lie. And I’ll get Ahab to listen to those dignitaries instead of Your real prophet; ’cause he’ll examine everything he says with your Word, he’ll examine his visions by the Word, he’ll examine everything he does by the Word, and if it ain’t with the Word he wouldn’t listen to it. But if it … I can deceive these others, and I’ll … they … Ahab’s got so much confidence in that great unity together of their safety, so they go around together and they’ll get together. And I’ll cause Ahab to listen to them, go out there. And that’s how we’ll do it.’” “God said, ‘You can do it, you’re a real deceiver; you go on down.’” And then Zedekiah smacked him in the mouth, said, “Where was you … ?” He said, “You’ll find out when you’re setting in the inner cell.” Uh-huh. He said, “Go up!” said Zedekiah to the king. Said, “Go up and return in peace!” Ahab said, “Take that fellow and put him into the prison. Put him in shackles, feed him bread of sorrow and water of sorrow. And when I return back with my victory from out here, which my prophets has told me that ‘this revival is sure to happen,’” said, “I’ll tend to that fellow!” Listen at Micaiah’s last words to that man: “If you return at all, then God never spoke to me.” Oh! See, God has His way of doing things. These men thought they were doing God a service. Be careful! Not emotion, not enthusiasm, not imaginations, but it must be “THUS SAITH THE LORD,” must be right. All right, no matter … We find these things so. Notice now when David had made this great proclamation, and it seemed like that it was good, a good thing to do. Then we find out that … (Am I tiring you? Am I too late to have another?) They had made this great proclamation, he consulted not the prophet. Now, anyone knows that Amos 3:7 said that God promised that He would never do nothing until first He revealed it to His prophet. Through the church ages we’ve had reformers; but promised by Malachi 4 that there would be a prophet in the land in the last days (because it has to fit that pattern, see) before the end time come. Before Jesus come the first, Elijah come, Elijah of Malachi 3. Matthew 11 says so, “If you can understand it, this is who was spoken of, ‘Behold I send My—My messenger before Me.’” Now, He’s prophesied, all theologians believe that; that, in the last day, the Spirit of Elijah is to come, too. It has to come five times, God uses that Spirit: Elisha, Elijah, John the Baptist, and for the Gentile church, and then for the Jews in Revelation the 11th chapter. That’s, God’s g-r-a-c-e, f-a-i-t-h, J-e-s-u-s, Jesus, the—the letter five. Can’t stop at four, it has to go to five. See? Notice! Now, He promised that, so that sets the Bible just exactly to this day, and the Sodom and Gomorrah. And Elijah was not … That wasn’t Elijah; That was the Spirit of God on Elijah; Elijah was just a man. Now, we’ve had Elijahs, and Elijahs’ coats, and Elijahs’ mantles, and Elijahs’ everything. But the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is to come according to Matthew the seventeen- … Luke 17:30, says the Son of man is to reveal Himself among His people. Not a man, God! But it’ll come through a prophet. Now, He never had two major prophets at the same time, never, in the world. See? No matter how much there’s … two—two heads can’t … It has to be one head. God has to get one man under His control. See? There’s one God; there was Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but one God over it all, notice, and just used them offices. So has He with Elijah, the Spirit of Elijah; he used that Spirit, but the same God controlling It all the time to fulfill His Word. Now, notice in this now, David thought he had everything in order. And he was inspired. See how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man? But it’s got to be in the order of the anointing. The outside spirit can be anointed with the Holy Ghost, and the soul as dark as pitch. The cocklebur grows on the same water that builds … puts life into the wheat, puts life into the cocklebur; but at the bottom of the cocklebur, it’s a cocklebur life. It’s rejoicing, and blooming, and got life, and doing everything that the wheat does, but the soul of it is cocklebur. See? False teachers can rise, teaching all kind of trinitarianism and everything else, and be anointed with the Holy Ghost, and perform just as many miracles as the true Gospel can. But by the Word here, that’s what does it. See what I mean? Now, it’s all right to teach this, I guess, I’m—I’m in a interdenominational tabernacle this morning, in—in this hotel here. Notice, watch what we’re saying. Now, well, listen. David had all the emotion that the real revival had. Notice! They shouted, they screamed, they danced, they really got something out of that anointing. Sure did! All like a real revival, but, you notice, God was not in it. God was not in it. He had a prophet setting right there in the land. They ought to have knowed. See? David should have knowed that. Something today, we got all the mechanics, like the great denominations, crusades of our time, but the result’s turning out the same as it was then; our results of our great crusades, and all of our big fine reason, our big buildings, and our big … building thousands, and adding members and things, it turns out the same way, all a flop. I’m not saying that to be different, I’m saying that to be honest before God, Whose Book I’m standing by this morning. See? All turns out a flop, same results. Now let us see what happened when God (in His time and age) and His prophets are not considered, just depend on theology, priests, denominationalism like we do today. Now, closely. It all gets messed up. If the true Spirit of God there, It’ll direct it into the Word; not just one place in the Word, the entire Word for the entire age. See? The Day of Pentecost, the Spirit directed it right into That, to Joel 2:38. See? The day of Luther, It directed it right into That; Wesley; in this last pentecostal move; but this is another age, this is the calling out of the Bride. Not two thousand years ago at Pentecost, or the repeat, or the return. Pentecost … The Holy Spirit was in Luther, the Holy Spirit was in Wesley; it’s God’s Word being anointed. And the Holy Spirit returned to the people of the age and they begin to have the restoration of the gifts. They found out, by yielding themself to God, the Holy Ghost spoke in tongues through them. They laid their hands on the sick, and they was recovered. They danced in the Spirit. See? That was the age of the reformation bringing the church back into order. And the last order of the church was placing the gifts into the church; like Luther placed justification, Wesley placed sanctification, Pentecost placed the gifts. But what did they do? The same mistake, as nature has patterned to the wheat stalk, they denominated (which is against God, contrary to God). Now, we find out that when … Then when these stalk gathers comes together, they form their own idea. And no matter … When the “new issue,” as they call it, come forth out of the Assemblies of God, what did they do? They couldn’t receive It. No matter how much Truth it was, the baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ, they were already the General Council. Man had done took it over, the Spirit had done left them. Right! And then this come forth … I’ve talked to some of your best leaders; they say, “Well, what would we do now?” They would embarrass themselves. When, they know it’s the Truth; if they don’t, they’re spiritually blind and ignorant to the Bible. Not saying that nasty, now, saying that reverently. Cause, there’s not a place in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized using those titles, “Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.” And never was used till after the ecumenical council, the Roman Catholic church. Their own catechism witnesses the same thing. It’s a Catholic dogma! Not a Bible doctrine, but a Catholic dogma. And you Methodists brought out your catechisms and everything just like they had, just gradually growing out of it. But now when you come to Pentecost, and spread out some of those dogmas, you still held on to them. But now is the Bride-calling, now is when the Seven Seals has been opened, now when the complete things that the reformers left has to be opened; and only Malachi 4 can do that, because it takes the revelation straight from God to an individual to do so. That’s right! It can’t come to a group, never did. One man! That’s what God promised in the shadows of the coming for His Bride, an Eliezer. See? Notice when priests, ministers, and so forth, get their own inspiration, and truly anointed. David was anointed. The Bible said so. But, you see, he went through the wrong resource, he went to the wrong channel. He channeled his anointing on the wrong side, to the people and what they thought, to the captains, what they thought, instead of to God’s holy channel to find out what THUS SAITH THE LORD was, “Is this the time for this? Is this the season for this? Is this the will of God?” Then if he’s a true prophet of God, he’ll go before God first, say, “Father, what is it?” like Nathan did later on to David. David said, “Is it right for me to live in a house of cedar, and the ark of my God under tents out here?” And look at Nathanael, said, “David, do all that’s in your heart, for God is with you. You’re a anointed vessel of God.” But that being a prophet, and his mistake, and God’s duty bound to His prophet. That night He appeared to him, said, “Go tell My servant David, I admire his courage, I love him for this, ’cause he’s a man after My Own heart, and I know it’s time that My ark would be that way, put under something, but I just … It ain’t the season for it to happen. I’ll let his son do it, but I won’t let him do it.” Then here come Nathan with, “THUS SAITH THE LORD, David, the great revelation you had is as wrong as it was when you brought the ark up.” (Uh-huh! Uh-huh! See?) “Don’t you do it. Don’t try it! But God said He’ll have ‘your son to do it.’” There! See? There you are! David was anointed to say that because aforehand he could see it, just as Abraham sought for a City on the earth. You know, he was looking for It because he was going to live here someday, Abraham is, in that City. And he went around looking for It. And right on the same grounds where he looked, it was just above him then, and will return in the Millennium and he’ll live in that City. But being a prophet, he was ordained and inspired, he knowed there was a City somewhere, and he was looking for It. But, you see, the whole revelation of it was hid from him. It wasn’t for his age. [Blank spot on tape — Ed.]  … on down to John, where he saw It coming down from God out of Heaven. That was the City. See, everything has to be in its season. You plant your wheat in the spring and … or in the fall and cut it the next summer. See? It’s got to come up through the stalk, then come up through the tassel, and shuck, and on into the … It’s got to be in season. All nature runs in continuity. The Spirit of God made nature, and all God and nature is in continuity. All the things that’s put in the temple was a pattern of what he saw in Heaven. You see a tree struggling trying to live, that means there’s a tree that don’t die. You see a man struggling for life, it shows that there is a tabernacle waiting somewhere that don’t die. “If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting.” The good Heavenly Father permitted me to walk behind that curtain one day and see it. How many heard the …?… See? Looking passed the curtain of time. There it was just the same as I’m preaching to you all, there they stood. Souls under the altar, crying, “How long?” Not just a myth, somebody who had intelligence: “How long, Lord?” See? While we feel that now, as our age, like Brother Bill Dauch setting here at ninety-three. There’s something longing for that young man again. There’s something … You’d give anything. How I’d like to. Brother Jack, and all the rest of us. Go back, Brother Gerholtzer, in here, into that young manhood. What do we want to do it for? To be young and run around again? No, sir! Because we feel we’d have more time to glorify this God that we love. And my dear brethren, I have this Message this morning, there is a Land beyond the river that they call that sweet forever. There we’ll glorify Him through the ages, and all the ages, and Eternity. Why do we feel that? Because the deep is calling to the deep. And as long as the deep’s calling, there’s got to be a deep to respond to that call or there wouldn’t be no call. Before there can be a creation, there has to be a Creator first to create the creation, or there’s no … That shows the very evidence that there is. Notice these priests, all out of line. Notice the anointing, all right, nothing wrong with the anointing. Same with you Pentecostals, but watch what channel you’re moving in now. The day has changed since Pentecost, something else for us. If there’d been no prophet in the land, perhaps David would’ve been right. That’s right. But there stood Nathan, vindicated, ordained, witnessed by God to be a prophet. Watch! The ark in the Bible always is a type of the Word to us, because it was the Word of God in the ark. And was … Notice the ark that they brought up, look how they did it. It was not put in its original God-ordained position. Now, God said back here in the Law that it must … how it must be done, how this ark must be moved, and who it must be moved by. But David, under his anointing … My brother, don’t you miss this. And my sisters, you who want to be women preachers and so forth, don’t you miss this. No matter how much your anointing is, you’ve got to get in God’s provided position. David’s anointing was all right, but in doing it he got enthused and stepped over the boundary line. What did he do? He stepped over the boundary line. Instead of putting the ark in its original position, he carried it on a new cart and not over the hearts of the Levites. It was supposed to be carried on the shoulder of the Levites, which is over the heart. The Word is not in the mind, It’s in the heart! “Not on a new cart.” What was that? Some … Represented something new, David did there, spoke of every denomination there’d ever be. God’s Word is not to be by … carried by state presbyters or bishops, and so forth, of denominations. It’s the Baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man, and not in some ecclesiastical move. The Holy Spirit is a treasure of God’s love in the heart of men and women to obey. See? Was on the shoulders of His ministers, His ministers was the Levites. Put it up over their left shoulder and packed that ark like that, because it was up over their heart. They had the burden of the Word on their heart. Amen! Now you got the burden of your denomination on your heart, the burden of your congregation: whether you’re going to build this, or do that, or do something else. The burden of how many more you’re going to get to your denomination; instead of the burden of the Word of the Lord, till that people will see only the Word of God and nothing else. But you got It on a new cart now. See? They’re packing It up here in the ecumenical council even, shouldered. I don’t want to get critical, and may God help me now. I just telling you the Truth. Now, influenced by creeds and ecumenical councils, the Word, the real Word of the season of that age was ignored, because they had a lot of emotion. But David, the anointed king … He was king, but he was anointed king. You say, “I’m a minister, anointed.” Then stay a minister, don’t try to be a prophet. See? If you’re evangelist, stay evangelist. Remember Uzziah, in the days of Isaiah, the young king … the young prophet. Uzziah was a great man, anointed man, God blessed him; blessed hisself. Yeah, I preached on that to you here one time. And one day he got so highly up till he thought he could just take the office of a priest, and he took the fire and went in before the Lord. And the … Them priests told him, “Don’t do that, Uzziah!” But he got exalted. The prophet couldn’t tell him nothing. The priests knowed their order, they was keeping their order, he said, “That’s not your order, Uzziah. Don’t do, that!” Well, he made them “Shut up!” And he went with the—with the fire, in to offer, take a priest’s job; he was anointed king, not a priest. And those priests was trying to tell him, “You’re a wonderful king, you’re anointed, God has blessed us fine. But you’re a king, not a priest.” And you pastors shouldn’t never tell a prophet what to do, or you evangelists tell a pastor. See, each one has his office if it is perfectly identified. So he went in with the fire, and was stricken down with leprosy and died. Now here is David, king. David is trying to do the same thing here. He’s taken it upon hisself. “Well, that’s fine, got to go. Look around at the people. What do you say, captain? You have ten thousand.” “Glory to God, David, I feel the Spirit.” Oh, he did! He did feel It. “What do you think, David? Do you feel It?” “Glory to God, It’s all over me! Let’s check it and see if it’s right, let’s see. Where does the ark belong?” “With us! Belongs among us.” “Who should we consult? Sure, the ark. Just the same thing as that ground belonged to—to Israel instead of the Philistines. That’s right. They belong to us. And as I feel the anointing, too.” The captains of hundreds, all the congregation, “Glory to God!” They clapped, and they shouted, and they danced, and jumped up-and-down. They had the Spirit, but what do you think Father was thinking? “How I’ve sent Nathan, that prophet down there! They know what to do, and so does David, but now he’s just all enthused and stepped right over his boundary line and went to do this.” All right, notice, “carry It on the shoulders” was God’s original plan. There is five must’s. I want you to put these down, if you’re … I see you’re writing. And it’s twenty minutes, twenty something minutes after ten, so I’ll try to be through by eleven, if possible. I’ll hurry just as quick as I can. No matter how sincere a man may be in doing God a service, no matter how sincere, how much anointed, how much of a Presbyterian, Baptist, Pentecostal; no matter whether you’re a bishop, deacon, whatever you are, pastor, evangelist, prophet, whatever it might be; there’s five must’s that must be considered first. No matter how much anointing, how good it seemed, how the people shouting, everything the Spirit’s doing, there is a must. Now, my brethren, while you’re getting your paper ready, can you understand now why? Now remember, you’ve all thought, and have been taught among you, not … (see, I’m speaking across the nation) … that I did not believe in speaking in tongues. I do believe in speaking in tongues, but you can still speak in tongues and not have the Holy Ghost. First Corinthians 13, says, “Though I speak with tongue of men and angels, I ain’t nothing yet.” See? That’s the anointing of the Holy Ghost, that has nothing to do with the soul inside you. You can speak in tongues and deny the Word. I’ve seen it done, and you see it too. See? A woman can preach the Gospel and … See? They can do all … They cut their hair, and still shout and speak in tongues and everything else. Uh-huh, that’s exactly right. You got to line up with the Truth of the Word. Notice! No matter how sincere a man may be, no matter how great he’s used of God, no matter what he is, he must be this: must be … The thing that he’s speaking of must be timely by the Bible. Somebody say, “Well, Moses back there.” I know what Moses did, but that not what God’s doing today. “Well, back yonder, thirty years ago, Luther said … ” That might be fine, but that’s not what He’s doing today. “Well, forty years ago, Pentecost fell.” But that’s not what He’s doing today. See? It must be timely. It must be according to the Scripture. It must be in season, secondly. Thirdly, and it must be according to the way that God’s Word spoke it would be. And you say, “Glory to God! The Holy Ghost fell on me, hallelujah, just like It did on the Day of Pentecost.” But that might be different today. It fell on David, too, didn’t it? Sure, It did. Fell on Uzziah, but it was wrong! See, you got to go deeper than that now. See? You got to go deeper than that. Now, don’t feel hurt, just—just be reverent. And notice, and it also must come to the man of God’s choosing. Not a denominational choosing, not of people choosing, but according to God’s choosing. And if it’s a message from God, of a great revelation from God, it must come to His prophet. Now, if you want the Scripture of that, it’s Amos 3:7. See? Now, it must. There’s five things it must be: It must be in season. It must be at the time God said it would be. It must be written in the Word of God. It must be in the season of God’s time, see. And it must be by God’s choosing. And God doesn’t need any of us to interpret His Word, God is His Own Interpreter. He don’t need our seminaries. He don’t need our wisdom, it’s nonsense. See? Eve got that, uh-huh, and missed the Interpretation by her wisdom. Say, “Oh, boy, that guy’s a smart man.” Well, that don’t mean a thing. Sure. Ahab was a smart man. Belteshazzar was a smart man. Satan was most cunning and crude, subtle, none of you could withstand him, none at all. I don’t depend on … none … no wisdom, just depend on God. See? How is God? He is the Word. And then how does God interpret His Own Word? Listen close now, don’t miss these things. How does God interpret His Own Word? By making It come to pass, not just one here, but all of it for that season. Not say, “Noah go out and preach,” the inspired, but, “Build an ark, put doors in it, fix it this way, and that way.” What if he put the door on top instead of the bottom? What if he put the window on the bottom, the door on top? See? It’s got to be instructed according to the time, because that’s exactly what God’s going to use it for. It must be that way, and it must come by inspiration. I heard a guy say one time, said, “I believe that man prays for the sick, I believe it’s fine. But as being a prophet,” said “I believe he’s God’s prophet; but as a teacher, why, he’s a ‘Jesus only.’” What a … What kind of a person would you call that? A man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The very word prophet means that “he is a revealer of the Word of God,” the Interpretation only comes to that. And that’s why today we’re in such a need of this great person that’s supposed to be sent to us in the form of the prophet Elijah, because it’ll be the revelation of God made known to us by vindication, showing that it’s the day and the hour and the season that God promised it to be in. And, remember, he’ll be spoken against; always has been, always will be. Rejected, just like the shuck will pull … First he’ll be accepted, because the shuck only holds the wheat until it’s able to get forth to the sun. Pentecost will only sheltered the Message, give It an open door until It gets scattered, and then the shuck will pull away, and the wheat will lay in the Presence of the Son, see, to ripen. There won’t be any denomination, just remember. Brother Jack here’s a historian, many of you here are. There’s never been a revival but about three years after the revival they started a denomination on it. Is that right? And this last great miracle move of God in this last days, it’s went twenty years; and it’s a million miles from a denomination, going further away all the time; the shuck’s pulling away, no cooperation, no nothing with It. See? Always it pulls away from It. There can’t be no more, it’s a wheat now. But we’re plenty green. Uh-huh. That’s right. Have to lay in the Presence of the Son to be mellowed up, that’s all of it. Plenty green; we haven’t got the sincerity, the sacredness, the thing we ought to have in our midst, to know that the Spirit of the living God, moving in His Word and showing us the things yet. We have false impersonators rise up. What’s that to do? To deceive. The Bible said they would. “As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so will these in the last days.” See? They do the same thing, come right along impersonating It, just exactly. See? Be careful! Watch the Doctrine of the Bible. Watch the message that follows them signs! Still the same old school of message? Forget it! God sent the miracles and signs to attract attention of His people. When Jesus come just healing the sick and so forth, so did the prophets. They thought, “Oh, glory, He’s coming, He’s going to be a Pharisee. He’s going to be a Sadducee.” But He said, “You generation of serpents and vipers.” Said, “You’re of your father the devil, his works you’d do.” Said, “Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His Blood, there’s no Life in you.” He didn’t explain It. He didn’t have to explain It. Hallelujah. That was for another season. Uh-huh. He just said what He had to say, “I always do that what is pleasing to the Father, and that’s keeping His Word. If I don’t, My life and My works don’t compare with His Word I’m supposed to do, then don’t believe Me, I’m not Him; but if it does, then believe the works if you can’t believe Me,” He said. Notice now these must’s that must be done. Now, see, God had not revealed the thing to them by His provided way, He had revealed it by inspiration, but it was in the wrong channel. See, inspiration will go fine, but if it’s in the wrong channel, it’ll be channeled wrong. Like you take a bullet and shoot it directly to a target, it’s making its way right to the target, but a puff of wind can blow it out. Now, in your automobile, you go down the road sixty, seventy miles an hour and a puff of wind blows you, you can straighten your wheels back up, throw it back in the road again. But you can’t a bullet; ain’t nothing there to straighten its wheels up, it misses the target. See, it must travel in its original channel. So must the Word of God travel in Its original channel. No little puff of wind is going to blow It off; no little denomination, or nothing, is going to blow It off; no little persecution’s going to blow It off: It’s directed to the point! It’s going to hit there, too. And then God … When It hits that point, God will vindicate It, “Bull’s-eye!” Uh-huh, exactly what He said He’ll do. Here it is in the Scriptures, this, “THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘It shall come to pass!’” Here it is. See? There you are. Now, God had not revealed it in His provided way. So they went about to do it apart from His Word, and apart from the season, just the same as they have now. When men, no matter how sincere, tried to do Him a service outside of His provided way, they always mess it up. Like Balaam, Balaam thought he was doing God a service. Do you think God lies? Does God ever change His mind? Well, people act today like He did. When He said for women not to cut their hair; they say, “We can cut it, Dr. So-and-so said we could. Brother So-and-so said you’re just too narrow-minded.” Uh-huh, uh-huh. See? “Well, can this happen? This happen?” “Yeah, uh-huh, So-and-so said so.” God don’t change His mind. Do you believe Balaam was a prophet? The Bible said he was. Do you believe he was a prophet? Now, remember, Balak come to him and said, “Go down and curse this people, for they’re all over the face of the earth. They’re not even a denomination, not a nation, they’re just a scattered bunch; and we are the dignitaries of the land. Now you go down there and curse that people, and I’ll pay you for it.” And Balaam done exactly what a prophet should do, he said, “I’ll not go. You just wait here, over the night, let me see what God says do.” So he went in, he said, “Lord, there is some people out here with me that come, wanted me go down and curse another people down there.” Said, “What do You want me to do about it?” God said, “Don’t you go, for them is My people!” Balaam went out, said, “Go on back to your house. I can’t go with you, God told me not to do it.” Now, there’s God’s original Word: “Don’t go!” Well, then they went back, said, “You know, your bishop wouldn’t listen.” “Well,” the king said, “tell you what we do. He needs a little money, I believe that could persuade him. Or maybe I’ll make him state presbyter, maybe I’ll get him some great something to do. I’ll might make him the bishop, you can’t tell what I might do. Here, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. You fellows ain’t got enough education to persuade him anyhow; your his and hain’ts, and tote and fetch and carry, ain’t right. He wouldn’t listen to you, we’ll send a real educated bunch down, more dignitary.” They went down there, said, “Doctor Balaam, Doctor Balaam, greetings to you. I bring you salutations from the king.” “Morning, brethren.” See? “Now, Doctor Balaam … ” And, oh, the vocabulary, how it was really poured on. And said, “Now, the king has said that he will exalt you, and he will also give you great honor. And, you know, they only offered you so much money to take this charge, but the king says he’ll triple it, quad-triple it, if you’ll just come to take it.” Then, Balaam got itching hands, though. He got foolish ideas and he stirred his mind. Now, remember, he called God by it, anointed, but he stirred God right away from the original plan. And that’s exactly what Pentecost has done! To be popular, you Oneness, you Trinity, for popularity you denominated to be different, you organized and you’re dead! You’ll never rise again. But, you see, you ought to have stayed with God’s orig- … He pulled you out of that Assembly to make you a people, but you organized and went right back into the same puke you come (excuse me) out of, the same stuff you come out of, “As a dog goes to its vomit and a hog to its wallow.” I’m sorry I said that, forgive me, that’s not right for the platform here. See? I just said that in the flesh. Notice now that that’s what I mean, to vomit. I should have said it like that. The word was all right, but just misused. See? It was used all right, but just a missound, you know. Vomit, “As a dog returns to its vomit.” If the Assemblies of God, the General Council, organized Pentecost at the first place and got them into that so they could not accept the revelation, don’t you know, Oneness, you done the same thing. How could you receive a Message of “serpent’s seed, Eternal security,” and these other things that’s come forth? You’re so tightly organized till you won’t even let It in your door, uh-huh, uh-huh, same thing Balaam did. But God didn’t change His mind. So Balaam went over and said, “Lord, now look, I really got an opportunity now to be somebody. You know I been a nobody, but I got a opportunity to be somebody. What do You say about it now, Lord?” Now, he should never said that! He knowed exactly what God said do! So do every one of you that’s baptized in the name of the “Father, Son, Holy Ghost,” on these other issues of the Bible that’s supposed to be in this day, you know what to do about It, is accept It! When you see God plainly vindicate “It’s the Truth,” that’s God interpreting His Own Word. But will you do it? No, your organization won’t let you do it! Many of the ministers there in Tucson that’s listening in this morning. Brother Gilmore, I have nothing against you; Brother Brock, First Assembly, and Friendly church. You men, I was there all that time, you wouldn’t even let me come in. I … Sure, you couldn’t, you can’t and remain what you are. You can’t accept revelation, ’cause you’re denominated. And listen, just as Uzziah was killed because he was under that false inspiration, so is many true Christians losing their experience back in those old dead denominations, because they’re putting their hand on the Ark when they’re not ordained to do so. Now you can believe It, or not believe It, that’s up to you. God’s your Judge. God never did take back His Word. What He said the first time, He says for every time. He told Balaam, “Don’t you go!” And then Balaam come back, said, “But Lord, could I go?” Now look! God said, “Go on!” Now, He give him permission to go. There is a permissive will of God, and not the original will of God. You see what a trouble he got into? And any man that builds anything, any organization, or anything outside of upon the Word of God, it’s shaking sands and will fall! It’ll die as sure as anything, because the Word of God is a growing Body of the Bride. You can’t have it all foot, all arm, all thigh. These things come in their season. And Pentecost, you made it all one thing, therefore you can’t accept new revelation. That’s the reason you stay right where you are and die. It moves on. (So much; don’t want to wear you out.) But God doesn’t change His mind, His first decision is exactly right. So God doesn’t change His mind, He just let you go on in your permissive will. “God’s a good God,” as Oral Roberts says. He’s also a fearful God! Look, just like you say, “Glory to God, I want to speak with tongues!” He’ll let you do it, but that ain’t no sign you got the Holy Ghost. Remember what Thomas said, the old doubter? “Unless I have some evidence, got to stick my fingers in His nails, His hands, and in His side, I—I—I—I won’t even believe It.” Now, there you are, the same thing. Jesus said, “Here you are, Thomas, stick your hands in here then if that’s what you want to know.” See? See? Now, if you want the Thomas route, go ahead. But what did He say? “How much greater is their reward who has never seen and yet believe.” Notice, notice, by doing this, he caused the death of sincere man; putting his hand on the ark when he shouldn’t have done it. A great, sincere man, think the anointing and everything was just right, but the ark was moving in it’s wrong way. “The oxen,” the Bible said, “stumbled,” not the Levites. The oxen stumbled and the cart was being pitched over; and a sincere man, with his heart full of love, put his hand upon the ark to hold it back, and was stricken dead because no man could touch that ark but a Levite. See how God keeps His Word, keeps His channel, keeps His order? Uzziah was smitten with leprosy. Here is David, altogether caused the death of a man, and a great disaster; being anointed with the Spirit, both of them, but out of God’s channel. Is that right? He died. Oh, it scared David to death, it called the—the name of the place, as Brother Jack read it. See? He marked him there. How many times denominations has done the same thing to sincere believers. The Catholic church, the Methodist, the Baptist, church of Christ, even the Pentecostals, has caused many spiritual death with that same thing. When It come, with these things, they found … and they can’t go no further, because that’s what their denomination believes. Look today, the big crusades, same thing. They don’t do nothing but make them more a “twofold child of hell, worse than they was in the first place.” Makes them harder, really, come to the Truth. Have one of these big revivals, and all of them come in, carry on a little while, and go back out and they start all this sin again. Hear of another revival, say, “Ah, I had some of that stuff, I tried. There’s nothing to it.” See? They don’t know the channel. Don’t see. I heard our great evangelist Billy Graham, set one morning at a breakfast like this, and he said, “I … ” Here, he puts up the Bible, in Louisville, Kentucky, said, “There is God’s example.” And that’s true, the man said the truth. He said, “You go … Paul went into a city and had one convert, come back a year from there and had thirty out of that convert.” Said, “But I go into a city and have thirty thousand converts, and come back in six months and can’t find thirty.” He said, “You know what’s a matter?” Said, “You lazy preachers,” said “you set around with your foot upon the desk and— and call these people by phone instead of visiting them after supper and talking to them.” Oh, my heart was burning. I thought, “O great man of God, I hate to disagree with you here, but who was the lazy preachers on Paul’s one convert? What he done, he took him into the Word, he took him into the Message, he took him to where he found God; his heart was on fire, he set the country afire! And only thing you do is put them in a Baptist or Methodist church, or something, no wonder there’s nothing to burn.” Uh-huh. Yes, sir! Then look what the Word has promised for today. Let’s find out whether it’s Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, or what, for today. Now you can go to read your Scriptures. Take these Scriptures I’ve been quoting to you. Also Revelation … If I had time, I’d read it, but I just haven’t. I got about twelve or fourteen more minutes. I got to close on time, at eleven, if I get out right. Notice Malachi 4, Revelation 10, Seven Seals. Didn’t the Bible say … Now watch! There was a Angel, a Messenger from above; and a earthly messenger. And each messenger was for the age of the church. He said, “In the days … ” speaking now, “there came an angel, messenger” (word angel, English word means “messenger”). “ … came down from Heaven, and He put His foot on the land and sea, and swore by Him that lives forever that time shall be no more.” Is that right? A rainbow around His head, and all these things just taking place. That Angel was Christ! Certainly! But what did He say? “But in the days of the seventh angel, the seventh church age.” Always it’s right at the end of the church age where they got the thing so … the ecclesiastic so messed up until God sends a messenger, and that’s the Message to that church age. Then they take his message, ’cause he just lived a little while, and God … then they take his message instead of carrying it on with the rest of It, they make a—a denomination. And then they come make another denomination; another messenger, take another one. You all seen in my book, it’ll all be drawed out in The Seven Church Ages, which He told me; which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged at the day of Judgment for It. It come from God, not from my thinking. Notice, here. I thought—I thought different from that, if I was going to have my own thought. Like Brother Jack told me about the Angel there, how that “That Christ was a glorified body.” But it wasn’t, it was showing that the Message being right, the Supreme Deity, He was God. See? Just the very thing I had been preaching from the Word. The Word always bears record of the Word. Now, quickly now, as we are fixing to close in a few moments. Now, He said, “In the days of the Message of the seventh angel, the earthly angel, seventh church age, then all these mysteries that’s been lost back through these other six church ages should be revealed right then.” Well, that’s exactly what those Angels said. Here is the Seven Seals, or the opening of these mysteries. And you try to get It before those denominations. Contrary to what they … Brother, they close up like a clam, but they’ve always done it. But it’s season! How many knows that this is the seventh church age? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen!” — Ed.] The Laodicean Age, a lukewarm that God spues out of His mouth. And they spue God out of their mouth; there’s not another age in the Bible where Jesus was found on the outside trying to knock, get back in. They put Him out, no cooperation. Who is Jesus? The Word! The Word was put out. The husks throwed out the wheat! He said, “I stand at the door and knock, and any man in them shackles out there will hear My Voice.” O God, have mercy! It was at then, when that man died, that David with the anointing saw what he had done wrong. O David, you pastor, can’t you see your dead creeds and denominations you’re holding on to? Can’t you see what it’s doing? It’s killing a Uzziah. Spiritually dead, and you wonder why there ain’t no revival; letting your women cut their hair, paint their face, wear shorts; send your boys away to ricky schools, and so forth like that, where half of them comes home homosexuals, and everything. Notice David’s objective: he was bringing the ark to his own house. That wasn’t the capitol, that wasn’t the place, it belonged in Jerusalem. But David was bringing it to his own house, he wanted the revival to be on his own denomination. “Oh, if you’re Assembly, all right. If you’re Oneness, all right. If you’re Pentecostal, okay.” Like somebody said, said, “Brother Branham, how you ever have anybody to listen to you?” Said, “I can see Billy Graham, he’s got every denomination in the country with him. I can see Oral Roberts, every Pentecostal hangs right to him. But,” said “you’re against the whole thing.” Uh-huh. Said, “How in the world do you ever get anybody?” I said, “It’s God!” “I the Lord hath planted it before the foundation of the world. I’ll water it day and night unless some of them should pluck it from My hand,” Isaiah. “I’ll water, I planted it. I put their names on the Book before the foundation of the world, by predestination. I’ll water it, just keep on moving. I’ll furnish the water, you just spray It out.” Right. See? “I’ll water it day and night unless one of them gets plucked out of My hand.” There you are. Want It come to the city of David, the city of Jerusalem. There was no place ready for it at that time, and so is it today. These great mysteries that’s been unfolded by the Seven Seals, there’s not a place in any denomination … would have to quit being a denomination to take It. All the way from Luther on down to the Pentecostal Oneness, there’s not a place can receive It. Neither can a man receive It and stay in his denomination. He’ll have to follow the wheat or go with the shuck, either one he wants to. Christ is our Ark, the Word. They want their denomination. He cannot, notice, cannot be carried on the new carts of the denominations, His Message cannot go on the cart of a new denomination when It’s supposed to be bore and come on the heart of a prophet. It cannot. He promised it, It would be thus, and that’s the way It must be. So the denomination will never receive It, neither can they receive It. And they’re just as blinded to It as the Jews was when they hung Jesus to the cross, when Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, they don’t even know what they’re doing.” Don’t despise them, but just think: for what if you was in that same condition with your eyes so blind that you can’t wake up and see what’s going on? Neither could they see that That was their very God. When He was hanging there on the cross, and them singing the 22nd Psalm in the temple, two hundred yards away, “My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me? They pierced My feet and My hands.” See? “All My bones, they stare at Me. Why has Thou forsaken Me?” And there, the very God that they had sung about, blind enough to have Him tacked to the cross, and didn’t know it. Now, don’t the Bible say that the Laodicean church, that thinks that she’s so great by her denominational members, she’d be “naked, miserable, poor, blind, and don’t know it”? What does the blind mean? The blind means for this Laodicean church like it did the ending of the Jewish church, blind to the very Christ that they had on the outside, knocking, trying to get in; “naked, miserable, poor, wretched, blind, and don’t know it.” O God of mercy! Why can’t the wheat lay out in the Presence of that Son yonder, and see the hour we’re living in? Yes, Christ is our Ark, but His original way to do it. Then here He is … They had His Spirit all right, we know that. They wait upon the Lord, see His plan on His original Word in Its season to be vindicated, that’s what we should be doing right now. And He—He reveals their faith by His Word, seeing Him confirm every plan that He promised, not man’s schemes of denomination, not making members for our own ark. They got a Methodist ark, a Baptist ark, a Presbyterian ark, everybody’s going into this ark for the great tribulation coming; “Glory to God! I was baptized in the Methodist ark, the Presbyterian, the Pentecostal ark.” There’s only one Ark, that’s Jesus Christ, and He is the Word! Notice, God told the prophet, said, “Eat the scroll,” in the Old Testament. The prophet of the New Testament, He said, “Eat the little book.” Why? That the prophet and the Word would be one! See? That’s the Ark, the Word of God. God has promised His Word, how It would be fulfilled and how It would come to pass when He chose His Bride, how it would be done. It’s happening right before you, in the Name of the Lord, and that’s by the original Word! The evening-time Message is here. How many remembers Haywood when he wrote: It shall be Light about the evening time, The path to Glory you will surely find. Yes, the evening promise of the Seven Seals, of Revelation 10, Malachi 4, Luke 30 and 10. Read Deuteronomy 4, 4:1 and 4, then 25th and 26th verse, and see what He said about for this last day. This was Moses saying to Israel to “Keep every Word, don’t you add one thing!” Moses, that prophet had been up there and seen that Word of God. And It was wrote out to him and vindicated by God’s Own handwriting It. He said, “You keep every Word, don’t you add one thing to It or take one thing from It.” You can read that in the 25th and 26th verse of Deuteronomy 4. Notice! Don’t you add to It, don’t you take away from It; ’cause if you do, God will take your part from the Book of Life. And it shows that you wasn’t His seed. Remember! Everything that God has promised us, everything that God’s spoke to us, everything that’s been told to you in the Name of the Lord, it has happened! God has never made one promise null, but He’s kept every promise that He said, has told us, has been the Truth for these twenty years, Shreveport. I’ve preached to you through the power of God, and the courtesy of your pastor, and I take you to record today. Even to women passed bearing; men, children, afflictions, healing, prophesy, things that would happen, not one of them has ever failed! Now, stay away from those denominations, they’re leading you to death. Samuel stood one day, and they said, “We want a king, we want to be like the rest of the world.” Well, Samuel said, “Don’t take that king. He’ll take your sons, and daughters, and he’ll do this and do that.” He said, “Yeah, I know you’re right.” But Samuel said, “Listen to me. Did I ever take any of your money? Did I ever beg you for a living? Did I ever tell you you had to give me so much salary to hold a meeting for you?” Now judge yourselves, even now! See? He said, “Did I ever tell you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass?” Not one thing. “Oh, yes, Samuel, you never did beg us for money, you never did want big things. Samuel, that’s true, and everything you told us in the Name of the Lord come to pass. But, Samuel, we want our denomination anyhow!” “Then go take it. It’s up to you.” That’s right. You can think you’re doing God a service, and if you’re going out of God’s way of doing it, you’re going to keep messing it up, on and on. O Church of the living God! Please forgive my Irish way and my sense of humor, but in the sincerity and sacredness of my heart, you Assemblies of God, you Oneness, Presbyterian, Methodist, whatever you are, flee for your life. Remember, get out from there. Nations are breaking, Israel’s awakening, (getting ready for that remnant) The signs that the prophets foretold; The denominational days are numbered with harrows encumbered, Return, O dispersed, to your own. The day of redemption is near, Man’s hearts are failing for fear, Be filled with His Spirit, Have your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near. Do you believe that? We’re at the end time, we’re here. The handwriting’s on the wall, the second Coming is at hand, the Bride is being chosen, watered, drawed out. Now, that don’t mean drawed out from church, that means drawed out from denominationalism. You must go to church, but don’t join any organization. Jesus went with all the organizations, but He never joined a one of them. Neither did He side with any of them, no indeed, but He was among them. There’s where the Light’s got to be scattered. And you stay right where you are, scattering the Light. See? That’s what God’s using you for. A hungry-hearted people, let them know that Jesus Christ is real, just the same as He was yesterday, He is today; and will be forever. It is possible, a man or woman with all sincerity, trying their best to do God a service, and stirred it in the wrong way. With a genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them, but stirred it contrary to God’s plan for the age, and chaos the whole thing. Now, if you believe that’s the Truth, say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen!” — Ed.] We just read It. Chaos the whole thing by not coming God’s provided way to do it. Let us pray. O church, here and across the nation, listen to your humble servant this morning. Will you? Look where you were at a few years ago when this first started; now look what impersonations has capitalized on It, and great millions and billions of dollars has flown into the organizations. See? Still away from the Word of God. Buildings and organizations is not the way God stirs His Spirit. He stirs It right into His Word, to make It live. And if you were ordained from the beginning of the earth to that Word, every Word will come right on top of the Word. Like a human cell will not have one human cell, and the next the cell of a dog, and the next the cell of a cat; it’ll be human cells. But it’s got to have a cell first to start with. Is that right? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] Well, if it is the Word cell to start with, the other Word cells are ordained to make it a full body. Don’t be children, only in love, but be men in Spirit and in judgment. Judge ye whether I’ve told you the Truth or not. Judge ye whether It’s the Word of God or not. Judge ye whether it’s the hour we’re talking about or not. Judge ye whether these things are promised. Now, are they vindicated? By things that there’s not a human being in the world could do it. But It’s become so common to us till we’re letting It flow right on past us. Wait, church, wait. If there’s one in here this morning that doesn’t know Jesus Christ, doesn’t stand justified this morning, your sins all gone as though you never had sinned, and you want to be that way … ’cause remember, one day, maybe today, maybe in the next five minutes, but one day that heart’s going to stop. And that inside of the inside is going to take its flight to stand in the Presence of God to be judged according to what you do with this Message this morning, according to this Message that you see. Not … It ain’t me, I’m just a mouthpiece. Like this microphone, it can’t say a thing ’less I’m talking in it. And neither could I say anything unless God was talking through it, but you see God’s vindicated it to be the Truth. You want to be a real Christian. Now, we have no place for an altar call, but right at the table where you’re setting. The place is packed and jammed, overflowed. I couldn’t call you to an altar, there’s no altar here to call you to. But the altar is in your heart. Won’t you let that little conviction that “Jesus Christ is real” move right up close today and call the rest of His body to you, manger Him in your heart? If He isn’t there, would you raise your hand, in a sign to Him, saying, “Lord, fill me, fill me with Your Word and with Your Presence, that I might live by You”? While every head is bowed, every eye is closed, all across the nation, raise your hands here in the visible audience and out there too; and I’ll offer prayer for you. That’s all I can do, I cannot fill it. God bless you. I cannot fill it. God bless you; and you. God can fill it. God bless you. Hands are going up here in the visible audience, everywhere. “Fill it. Fill me, O Lord. Fill me.” And now, after I … Thank you, sister. Thank you, brother. God bless you. After I … God bless you, sister dear. You. After … I think now I’ve caught the most of the sincere, trying to be, I want to raise my hands with you. O Lord, never let me come to a standstill. Continually, Lord, let me not stop at one thing, let me just move on, Lord, till I have completed everything that You ordained for me to do. Regardless of the price, regardless of the cost, regardless of the criticism, how hard the cross is, I’ll remember the cross that You bore. So this consecrated cross I’ll bear Until death shall set me free; Then go home, a crown to wear, There’s a crown for me. Must Jesus bear the cross alone, And all the world go free? No, there’s a cross for every one of His sons, There’s a cross for me. Dear God, the Word has gone forth. It cannot return void, It’ll find Its place somewhere. If the seed has already been planted, It’ll water it till it grows. And none can pluck it from Your hand, “All the Father has given Me will come to Me, no man can pluck them out of My hand. My Father has given them to Me before the foundation of the world”; when the plans were all drawed up, as so, Jesus was given His Church, His Bride. The bogus marriage of the world, to these denominations. You came and died into the world, You redeemed Her, You justified Her, She never did it at the first place. She was trapped into it, blind. And as the song says: I once was lost and now I’m found, I was once in Laodicea, blind, but now I see. And it’s grace that taught my heart to fear, It was grace my fears relieved; How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed. And the water of God fell upon my soul. I was parching. God, at this little altar of every heart present here and around the nation, may the waters from under the altar of God gush out this morning upon Your Church; and water it, Lord, for the season’s just about finished. Give it Life, the Waters of Life, that it might be able to lay in the Presence of the Son to be ripened for Your great garner. Father, I pray for them. But the stalk must dry, so I cannot pray for it; it must die, so it is dead. But I pray for the wheat, Lord, that’s forming into the Body of Christ. Grant, Lord, that the fresh waters of God will keep Its cheeks bathed with tears of joy and understanding until the combine comes to take it Home. In Jesus’ Name, I commit it all to You, Lord; the results is Yours. Amen. [A sister in congregation gives a message — Ed.] Amen. So Father, God, we thank You. And, Father, we pray for our little sister, handsmaid here, for her strength. I’m thinking of a time that when I—I walked in the presence of her, how that the Spirit came upon her and gave the same message that the Angel of the Lord gave on the River that day: “As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus, you are sent to forerun the second.” Seeing it shaping up now into the wheat part, God, we thank You for everything You’ve done. Our hearts are filled beyond speaking. I feel so full, Lord, I just don’t know how to say anything else. But thank You Father, again, for all that You have done for us. Through Jesus Christ’s Name. I love Him, … Let’s just sing to Him, now. Remember, He’s here. Because He first loved me, And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. Does it make you feel real little, real little? All emptied out, just ready for the Spirit, see. Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Covet not this world’s vain riches, That so rapidly decay, Build your hopes on things Eternal, (no denomination, now) Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! How many is trying to do that? Raise your hand. Now reach right across the table, put your hands in one anothers’ hand, like this, together. You can be seated, that’s all right, or whatever you want to do. Listen closely. Let’s sing it together now. This represents our unbroken chain of the love of God. We’re holding one anothers’ hands because we believe in God. We touch each other because we’re brothers and sisters, the same vibrating Spirit, the Eternal Word of God dwelling in our hearts being made manifest. When our journey is completed, If to God we have been true, Fair and bright our home in Glory, Our enraptured soul shall view! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! (Spirit of the Lord!) Hold to God … Just get your mind on Him, see. This is the kind of meetings we must set in in the future.  … unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eter- … The Word is the only thing there is Eternal. Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Covet not this world’s vain popularity, education, That so rapidly decay, (Look at it today, what it’s done.) Seek to gain the heavenly treasure, They will never pass away! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! [A sister speaks in another tongue. Brother Branham begins humming Hold To God’s Unchanging Hand. Another sister gives an interpretation — Ed.] How we thank You, Lord. As we set in this solemn moment, almost like a funeral, for we’re facing the burial of a dying, dead world; a dying, dead church. O God, gather Your wheat quickly, Father. Come quickly, Lord Jesus. Bless Thy people, Father, bring sincerity and deepness to the hearts of the people. May we get off of those fragile bubble dances, settle down into the deep riches of the honey of God. Grant it, Lord. Keep our hearts established with love and sincerity. Bless Thy people everywhere, Father. As we leave this place may we go in the Name of the Lord Jesus to speak that which is sincere, that which is Truth, that which is right, may we shun that what’s wrong, Lord. When a man begins to lie to us, may we quickly turn our back upon him, turn our back to all dirty, filthy jokes and things of the world, and just turn our back and walk away. Help us, dear God. Mold us, make us, break us, and make us into the images of sons and daughters of God that we might act with the virtue of the Holy Spirit. We commit ourself to You, with our hands in each others’, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Let’s stand. Brother Noel. 
You be seated. It’s good to be back again tonight. Thankful we have this opportunity again now to serve the Lord. And after keeping you so long last night, I feel it wouldn’t be fair to keep you long again tonight. Just back there listening to an associate brother of ours, in the Lord, that just come from Indiana, stirred by a strange dream. He’s never be in Shreveport before, in his life. But he dreamed, the other night, that he come to Shreveport, not by his car. And he come with a … or come somewhere, to a church where I was speaking. He said, after I had preached and prayed for the people, said, “‘Something’s going to happen.’” Said, he “was back the next day.” And he said, he “knew the building, how it looked.” Said, “There was a civic auditorium across the street, but they never went in the auditorium.” Said, “It was on this side, in a stone building that had a wing to it, and the building set just like this.” And the boy is a dreamer, I’ve seen his dreams and know that they’re true. And he said, “Then on the last night” that I “was speaking and praying for the sick.” And I said, “‘Something’s fixing to happen.’ And sounded like a clap of thunder.” And said, “The people begin screaming.” And said, “As the thunder begin to go away, well,” said “It made a voice, and begin speaking.” Says, “That speaking was going on, that through these lattices (windows up here) come the Glory of God, moving in, in the form of the Pillar of Fire.” He’s never seen It. He’s heard us talk about It, but he’s never seen It himself. And said, “There It was, come through the windows up like that, and formed that Light like you see in the picture, right above the audience here.” And said, “It was rumbling off something.” And said, I “stood, and said, ‘That is Jehovah God.’” And said he “was reminded of (when thinking about It) when Moses called the … brought the people out of Egypt. And they said, ‘Let Moses speak, and not God, lest we die.’” He said, “Everybody was laying on the floor, their hands up, screaming.” Said he “was screaming, too, ‘Lord God, I love You! I love You!’” And his wife shook him and woke him up. See him going down the aisle right now, Brother Jackson, a former Methodist preacher. And he was so disturbed, till he come down; and said when he walked in, he “was so astounded,” just exactly the way he had saw it in a dream. I don’t know what it means. The Lord’s kept it from me. But something could happen, seeing Brother Jackson dreamed that, knowing him as an honest, real man, servant of God. And I know of him dreaming dreams, coming to me, and the Lord gave me the interpretation, it’d be just perfectly like that. Even to, one time, my going to Arizona, he had the dream of it. And he’s very much disturbed. He’s with his wife, he brought her. She’s to be mother right away, and the only way he could go was by airplane. He didn’t have a penny to come, and somebody give him the money. And so it’s kind of worked out mysteriously, so something could happen; we hope so. We don’t know just what the Lord will provide for us. Now, we are grateful to the Lord to be living in the day that we’re living in, just before the coming of Jesus. As I have said before, it’s the greatest time of all history. I’d rather be living right now than any time, to … on earth. I see here in front of us, again tonight, is my good friend, Brother Dauch. I mentioned him in the auditorium this morning. Brother Dauch is ninety-three years old today, how blessed it is. He contributes his long life to the glory and praise of God, ninety-three today. “Happy Birthday” to you, my brother! And I know out, down, around the country where they’re listening in tonight, they also wish Brother Bill Dauch a “Happy Birthday.” He’s a very personal friend of Oral Roberts, many, has helped so many in the Gospel way, and everything. He’s a great friend of ours. Glad to see Brother Mann here, another Methodist preacher, saved and baptized with the Holy Ghost, and in the Name of Jesus Christ, setting here. He’s, also, one of our associates from Indiana. And I understand Brother Hickerson’s setting here by him, one of our deacons from Jeffersonville, Indiana (they’re listening in up there tonight). And I understand that Brother Wheeler, one of the other deacons are here somewhere. And I haven’t located him just yet, somebody pointing their fingers over and I’ll catch him after a bit; setting over, way over to the right, yes. Brother Banks Woods, if you’re listening in tonight, your brother was here last night. I seen him as I went out, Brother Lyle. Jehovah Witness; the whole group was converted. Lyle was brought in because a vision of the Lord. Lyle was setting in the boat there that day, when the day before it was told him that “something” was “going to happen concerning a resurrection of life.” He was a real Jehovah Witness, too! But that morning, setting there, fishing, and he caught … Well, he had a great, big ol’ (that Kentucky fashion, you know) … a big hook and a little, bitty fish swallowed it. And he just pulled gills, entrails and all out, throwed it out on the water (little, bitty sunfish), and he said, “Well, little fellow, you shot your last wad.” The little … flipping along on the water, died, the wind blowed him up into some pond lilies. And the day before, setting, I said, “The Holy Spirit tells me that ‘there’ll be a resurrection of some little creature.’ Perhaps there’d be a kitten, when I get back home, ’cause just … ” When we was trying to dig some fish bait, Brother Woods and I, who’s listening in tonight, my little girl which is a young woman setting here, engaged to this lanky soldier. As they … She come up, she said, “Daddy … ” Her and the other little girl, said, “We … ” Now, anybody can have any kind of pet they want, but I sure don’t like a cat, so she … or no Branham. So we … she said, “Oh, we found a poor ol’ cat out here, Daddy. It’s eat something and it’s … somebody’s poisoned it, it’s all swelled up.” Said, “Daddy, it’s going to die right away, can we get a little box and keep it a couple days?” I said, “Let me see the cat.” Well, they went and got the cat. I seen what was going to happen, so give her a box. And next morning, was about seven or eight kittens there, you know. So my little boy, Joe, picked one of them up, and squeezed it and dropped it on the ground; and just … little fellow lay there wiggling around and around, killed it. And I said to Brother Lyle, his brother, I said, “You know, it may be that it’d be that little kitten raised up, like we have seen the Lord do things.” Brother Lyle, just new in the way. The Holy Spirit had just told him he was married, and what he had done, and the evils he had done, the things he had done. Well, he thought Brother Banks was telling me them things. But when It really brought him right out, and told him what he done the night before, that was too much for him. He couldn’t get it. Then, the next morning … While we fished all night, with little fish, we was catching some for bait. But he just throwed that little fish in the water, quivered, flabbed over. About a half hour later we were setting there, and I was … I said, “Brother Lyle, you let the fish swallow the hook all the way down in his stomach. See?” I said, “Take the fly line here, flip it over, the bait out like that; just soon as he touch it,” I said “then just hold him and then bring him in.” I said, “He … don’t pull him out like that, don’t swallow it, you catch the fish.” He said, “Well … ” He had a great, big ol’ line hanging over, said, “This is the way we do it,” like that. So, just about that time, I heard Something coming off the top of the mountain up there, a whirlwind, whirling around and around. Here It come down like that, and the Spirit of God come over the boat, said, “Stand up on your feet.” Said, “Speak to that dead fish. Say, ‘I give you back your life.’” And that little fish had been laying there for a half hour, with his entrails in its mouth, and its gills. I said, “Little fishy, Jesus Christ gives you back your life. Live, in the Name of Jesus Christ.” Flipped over on his back, and down through the water he went as hard as he could go. Brother Lyle, are you here somewhere? I seen you last night. Whether he’s inside, outside, or where he’s at, raise your hand if I can see you. [Someone in congregation says, “Balcony”.] What say? In the bal- … Oh, yes, way up in the balcony, through the windows back there. That’s the man, a Jehovah Witness. He said, “Brother Branham!” He was all excited, he said, “Uh, it’s good to be here. Isn’t it?” He said, “Uh-uh, do you … Uh, do you think that meant me, that, that I called that little fish, said, ‘You had shot your last wad’?” Said, “That meant something for me?” I said, “Nah, nah, just a confirmation.” He was all upset about it. Well, we travel along and you see those things happening, knowing … Now, just think, what was it to show? I had a-many little spastic child on my prayer list, praying for it, but when the vision come it was for a little ol’ fish about so long, about two inches long or three. Looked like the hook was as big as the fish. But what it was, was to show you that God looks on the little things too. See? One day when lepers was laying all over the country, He used His power and put a curse on a tree. It begin to wither, when there was people laying everywhere needing that healing power. But, you see, He wanted to show He’s God over everything, whether it’s small, whether it’s big, whatever it is. He’s still God over all things, all the creation. So we love Him because … That gives us to know, if He’s interested to speak the Word of life into a little insignificant fish laying there dead, on the water for a half hour, He can certainly someday speak Life into His children. No matter if your body be no more than a spoonful of dust, He’ll speak, and we’ll answer Him someday. He’s God who’s interested in everything, all that we do, all that we say, everything. He’s interested. Now let us bow our heads, everywhere. I wonder now, before we pray, if there’s anybody tonight that’s interested in Him, but yet you haven’t got your reservations yet for the other Land where we’re going to see Him. You know, you can’t come in without reservations. And you haven’t made them yet, but you would like to be remembered in prayer now, that everything will be made right between you and God tonight, would you just raise up your hand; you’ll say, “Remember me, Lord”? You’re … just let Him see your hand. God, grant it. Heavenly Father, as we stand tonight between the living and the dead; and these things that’s happening in these days, mysterious, sure they’re mysterious; but God, You know whether they are true or not, You are the solemn Judge of the heavens and earth. And we say this, Lord, just to encourage the people (some of the things that Thou has showed us), that they might be encouraged to love You and believe You, serve You, and to know that no matter how little the deed is, good or bad, You see it. I pray, dear God, that You’ll bless every one of those hands tonight, and the soul and spirit that motivated that hand to go up. And I pray, God, that this will be the night that their reservations will be made for that Land beyond the river. Grant it. Heal the sick and the afflicted, Lord, both here, all out across the land where the broadcast through the phones are coming in. Bless those out there that’s unsaved, all the way from California to New York, from Canada to Mexico. Grant, Lord, that every person under the sound of our voice, tonight, will be saved from their sins, healed of their sickness, because of Your Divine Presence. And this our Brother Jackson, who’s flown all the way down this thousand miles here, to be here because something strangely stirred his heart; “And they shall dream dreams, and see visions.” Dear God, Thou hast kept it a secret from me, what this means; I don’t know. But if You shall visit us, Lord, prepare our hearts now for that visit. That we might be under expectations, not knowing what You will do, and not knowing if You have promised to visit us by this dream; we do not know. But we are just quoting those things that we do understand, that You promised to visit your people, and we pray that You’ll make Yourself real to us here. In the Name of Jesus Christ we ask it. Amen. Now, tonight, after keeping you so long last night and this morning, and I kind of getting a little bit hoarse. I got a little piece of hair I got, I wear over my bald spot here when I’m preaching. But I forgot it this time, and this air, sweeping through these windows, is begin to give me a little bit of hoarseness. I used to … I’d have to close meetings, but since I got that, then I don’t bother with it no more, I just go on. And I forgot it, and it’s … I’ve … kind of can feel it, so your prayers will be appreciated. And now, these are two services each day, that they are … kind of get … You know, when you got a lot of miles, it … you can tell it. So now to you people in California, and out in Arizona, we all send greetings across the nation. Brother Leo and the group that’s waiting on the Lord up at Prescott, invited now, and all you people around Phoenix, a week from tonight, we’re to be over in Yuma at the banquet. They done sold out all their tickets over there and got a bigger auditorium, and they can’t place the people. So come early, you all, to get in. Then we’re going on into Los Angeles from there, next Monday … next Sunday, Sunday night. And so we’re looking to see you all over there. God’s rich blessings rest on you all. To you in New York, and you that are around up in Ohio and different places, soon I want to preach the Message of The Trail Of The Serpent (the beast at the beginning, and the beast at the end), at the tabernacle. Billy will send you a note for that, when we’re going to speak it, ’cause I do that in the Tabernacle because it’ll, at least, be four hours or more long. So now … so I want you here, here and wherever you are now, to turn to the Book of Job. Very strange Book to preach from, but I want to just use a few notes here now. And then, tomorrow morning, here at the tabernacle, there’ll be Sunday School services at … We start here at what time? [A man says, “Nine-thirty.”] Nine-thirty. And then I have the privilege of speaking here again tomorrow. And the Lord willing, I wanted to speak on the subject … if He’s willing, now, as I was studying this afternoon, to show you that, “There’s only one place that God will meet a worshipper.” Uh-huh, only … And can tell you what that place is, and what the Name of that place is, where God will meet the worshipper. And then, tomorrow night, I’m going to ask a favor, that is, for a healing service. And I want an old-fashioned healing service. And if the Lord willing, I want to speak on a subject that alarmed me today … When Brother Moore and I were talking out together, my precious brethren, we were discussing Scriptures. And how lovely it was to be with them brothers, like old times. And he said, “You know, Brother Branham, all the preaching you ever done for us here in Shreveport, The Lamb And The Dove was one of the most outstanding messages you ever brought us here at Shreveport.” Said, “I guess with your Message so strenuous to you today, you never get to one like that.” “When I miss That, I miss my Message.” Love is my … Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious Blood Shall never lose its power, Till all the ransomed church of God Be saved, to sin no more. Ever since by faith, I saw that stream Thy flowing wounds supplying, Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die. Tomorrow night, if it be the will of the Lord, I want to preach on a subject on: On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove. Tomorrow night, “The Lord coming down on the wings of a Dove,” that is, if the Lord willing, my voice don’t get too bad. Now … so, pray for us. And then I want an old-fashioned prayer meeting like we had at the beginning, no discernment, just simply give everybody a card that wants to be prayed for. Now, you must have a card, so be here early so Billy can give you a card and keep it lined up. If you don’t do that, people just keep doubling back, and doubling back, and doubling back, and there’s no end to the line. Anybody can have a card. I want Brother Jack to stand by me at the prayer line, like you use to, and Brother Brown to bring the people to me instead of Billy Paul. I want an old-fashioned prayer line, and we’ll just pray the way we used to years ago. I’m glad tonight to have another associate brother with us, just looked around and recognized then and seen him, a few minutes ago, Brother Gordon Lindsay. He’s one of the old timers, was with us a long time ago. Doing a great job, printing, he’s printing my book now: The Seven Church Ages. We hope to have it ready again, The Seven Seals. If he happens to read that before he prints it, we’re going to have a theological discussion. I can just feel it coming. But he knows I’m no theologian. So … But we’re looking forward to tomorrow night. If you’re in, Brother Lindsay, be here tomorrow night. If you are, drop around and be with us on the platform for an old-fashioned prayer meeting. How many would like to see one of them old-timers again, where we bring the people up? That’ll be fine. Now, bring out your sick and afflicted, tomorrow night, for that purpose then. Now, if you got the Book of Job, the 42nd verse … or 42nd chapter, and the first six verses of the 42nd chapter of Job; very strange. Brother Ted Dudley, if you are listening in tonight, over in Phoenix, you remember you and I talking one time, about a week or two ago, and we referred to this? I told you, “Someday that would become a text to me.” And I want to use it tonight. Then answered … Then Job answered the Lord, and said, Listen close to this reading now. I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no doubt can be witholden from thee. Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. Now I want to take a text from that 5th verse. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye seeth thee. May the Lord bless His Word. Job, let’s take a little of his life. Job was a prophet. He was a man that lived back before the Bible was written. It’s been thought that Job was one of the oldest Books of the Bible, because It was written before Genesis was written. Job, this great warrior and prophet, was a mighty man in his day. No doubt that he had been brought up and had served the Lord all of his life. And had lived such a gallant life to the people, all had respects for him. But he’d come to a place to where he calls it here, being tempted of the Lord. But I’d like to use the word, being “tested” by the Lord. And truly, “Every son that cometh to God must first be tested, tried, child-trained.” And then if the testing gets hard, and we think it’s too hard and won’t listen (take heed), then He said we “become a illegitimate child, and not a child of God.” Because, there’s nothing can move a real, borned-again child of God away from his Parent, see, he’s part of Him. You can no more deny it, you deny yourself. See, you’ve had the experience, you’ve been trained and tested. And now, this man being a prophet, he had had access to God’s grace, but Job didn’t have a Bible to read. He … the Bible wasn’t wrote then, but he had access to God by revelation and by vision. That was before the Bible was written. Now, we find out, and take some of his life, when God blessed him and made him a great man. Why, even everybody respected him, even to his wisdom, had become so great. His inspiration from God had vindicated him to be God’s servant, so plainly, until the people come from everywhere to hear him. And then Satan begin to accuse that man. And that’s the way he does every inspired servant of God, Satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that’s not right. And, now, we find out his life and trials, and his great faith. Even Jesus, when He came on the earth, He referred to the patience of Job. He said, “Have you not read of the patience of Job?” Faith waits with patience for the promised Word to be fulfilled. Now, we notice here that Job, after he went through his trials, all of his afflictions … He had a lovely family, they were taken from him. He had good health, it was taken from him. Everything that he owned in this life was taken. And he set on a ashheap, with a piece of crock, scraping his boils. And even to his own wife, spoke against him, she said, “Why not curse God, and die?” He said, “Thou speakest like a foolish woman.” He said, “The Lord gave, and the Lord taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord!” Now, Satan had come up before God, ’cause he could come before God, and accused the Christians (or, the believers) all the time. So he accused Job of many things, and said that “Job, the reason he could serve God, because everything was coming good for him.” But said, “If You’ll just let me have him, in my hands, I’ll make him curse You to Your face.” I want you to notice that the confidence that God had in a believer. See? He’s … In other words, God said to Job … or said to Satan, like this, “You can’t do it! He’s a just man justified. He is a good man. He … there’s not one like him in the whole earth.” O what a man; that God Himself would say to His enemy, “My servant is so perfect, there’s not another man on earth like him.” Oh! If we could only be that kind of a man! That God could bestow that confidence upon us! That know that we’ll not twist from His Word or His Being, any way! Stay exactly, and He can put His trust in us. Now, Job was a man that carried out God’s commandments to the letter, exactly. And Satan knew that, but he said, “If You’ll just let me have him, I’ll make him curse You to Your face.” So God told him, He said, “Now, he’s in your hands, but don’t you take his life.” And Satan even stretched as far as he could on that. He took every friend, and everything he had, almost his complete life, but he couldn’t take his life. But Job still held right on, there was no turning back. You see, when a man or a person has once really come in contact with God, with that genuine, revealed faith that “God is!” There’s nothing, no time, no where, can ever separate that man from his God. I believe it was Paul said, “There’s no strife, no hunger, no perils, neither living creatures, or death, or anything that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.” You are securely anchored in Him because you were ordained to that Life. But Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit, and cuff him up, and make him do it. But, you see, Job with his perfect revelation of God, and Who God was, and how God loved him, he waited! No matter what the circumstances was, he waited for his faith to be confirmed, because he had had a grip on God, a revelation. That I spoke of last night. Now, when the sick people that’s in the building, the crippled people, or you that have a need of God, when you can get that type of a revelation that you are “justified,” when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you’re asking for, and believe that “He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek after Him,” there’s nothing can ever separate you from that faith that’s anchored to you. See? But, first, it has to be revealed to you. Someone come not long ago, a group of man, some of them listening in tonight, and told me, said … I kept telling them, “Go to Kentucky, oil’s down there.” I knew it was, I seen it in a vision. Well, Brother Demos and them didn’t go for a long time. After while, finally, they said … After Texas had moved in. And they said, “Now we’re going down.” I said, “You ought to have went a long time ago.” But they didn’t do it. Demos said, “I made a great mistake in that, by not doing that, Brother Branham.” I said, “If you’d have went down there, you’d have had it all.” Well, they wouldn’t listen to it. Then the first … then ’fore we left that night … The place where we were having lunch. The Holy Spirit showed me a great crack in the earth, and in that was full of oil, and these overflows in Kentucky was just little beds of oil that they were pumping from, but this one come from the main stream. And I said, “Brother Demos, it’s there.” So they went to searching for it. Said, “Go down and tell us where the oil well is.” I said, “Oh, no! No! No!” See, we don’t use the gift of God for commercial. No! No! He could tell me where it was at, but I don’t have any need of it. I wouldn’t even have faith enough to ask Him. See? If I had a need of it, I believe if I’d ask Him, He’d tell me. But first, you see, your motives and objectives has to be right. You have to have reasons for this. God don’t give you those things just because you ask. And you cannot ask in faith unless there’s a real objective to that, to be in the will of God. See, if you want to be well, what do you want to be well for? See, if you want to be healed, what’s the reason you want to be healed? What are you telling God? What do you want to do with your life when you get healed? See, there’s got to be … you’ve got to have a motive and objective, and they have to be right according to the will of God. And then’s when the faith is revealed to you, and God by His sovereign grace places that faith in there, then it’s over. See? Now see? Now, to make that Word true, when the brethren got down there, they got … one fellow went over and bought a bunch of stuff, and sold leases, and cheated the other one this way. I said, “You see, it won’t work.” Now just to make the prophecy sure, within a hundred yards of where these men were digging their well, some man struck the big gusher. And it’s there, eleven hundred barrels of oil in a half a day, or something or other like that; still putting it out, right in that main stream. But just to make the prophecy, the Word that had been said that it was there, it was there. The rest of them nearly’s all dried up, everywhere through Kentucky. Little ponds, they pump them a little while, they go. It’s only the overflow from this. See? But, because of the selfishness got among it, the objectives was wrong, signing up a bunch of stuff “it would be this way,” when they promised they would do it for the Kingdom of God, but look like it’s for themselves. See? And it won’t work, no selfish thing will work. Your motives and objectives has to be exactly, perfectly right, then you have faith, to ask. “If our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence.” See? See, we’ve got to have confidence. “I want this to the honor and glory of God.” Then faith has a channel to move into; if it doesn’t, then you got mental, intellectual faith, and not genuine faith from God. That intellectual faith will get you nowhere. Might get you emotional, but it won’t get you the healing that you’re looking for. So, Job, checking himself with the genuine faith that God had give to him that he was “just,” that he had done everything that God required him to do. Now when we’re going to be prayed for, for our sickness, I wonder if we have done everything that God requires us to do. Have we followed every iota of the Scripture? Have we give Him our hearts and lives to service? What’s the reason you want to be healed? That’s the reason you can’t get faith enough, see, because you haven’t maybe made this thing to God sincerely from your heart. Like Hezekiah did, give God the reason, he wanted to set his kingdom in order. And God sent His prophet back and told him, and he’d be healed. See? But, you have to have those things made right, first. So then as soon as you get to these places and know that it’s been revealed to you by the Word of God, by the revelation, by the Word that God requires you to do, then you have faith, genuine faith. Now, just like Abraham when he was ninety and nine years old. I believe, Genesis 17. God appeared to this old man, now, ninety and nine years old, when he was almost a hundred years old, that had been waiting upon that promise all these years. He appeared to him in the name of El Shaddai, the “Breasted-one.” And what an encouragement it was, yet the promise wasn’t fulfilled then. But, “Abraham, I am the Almighty God, El Shaddai, ‘the Strength-giver, the Breasted God.’” Like I’ve told you before, like the little baby that’s fretting, and sick, and crying, and it lays upon its mother’s breast. And nurses its strength back from her, because it’s satisfied while it’s nursing, because the only access it has and knows of is the mother’s breast. It knows no dose of medicine. You might give him a dose of medicine, he’d squeal and cry. Give him a shot in the arm, and he’d carry on. But the only access to satisfy him is the mother’s breast. And He said, “Abraham, you’re old, your strength is gone, your arms are withered up, your manhood’s gone, but I am your Mother. Just take a-hold of My promise, and be satisfied while you’re waiting. Be rested!” Now, that’s the way every believer, no matter how bad the cancer’s got you, how long you been setting in a wheelchair, any of those things, just if you can grasp that revelation from God! Then be satisfied, knowing that it’s going to happen, because faith waits patiently for the promise. See? Job knew that he was right. When we find out, here in the Scriptures, that there was … these fellows come to him; his church members. Everything that once seemed dear to him had turned against him, and tried to accuse him of being a secret sinner, because all these things had happened to him. You hear people, yet today, say, “I told you. Look at him! You see what … ?” That ain’t altogether the truth. Sometime it’s God testing His people. In this case, it was God testing Job, the best man there was on earth at the time. Now, He was holding him then, because that He knew Job was a prophet that had a vision from God, that he had exactly done what God told him to do and he … God was duty bound to keep His promise to him. Oh! All Christians has got to be that. When the last struggle of our life comes, and death rattles are in our throat, we still must hold steady and remember that God said, “I’ll raise you up again at the last day.” See? Got to hold that, our testimony, our place in Christ, our position, what we are, knowing that we have kept every Word of His commandment. “Blessed are they that do His commandments that they might have the right to enter in.” See? And when we know, that no matter what anyone has said, we’ve kept every commandment that we see in the Bible, that God has done us … told us to do, with reverence, and love, and respect to the Creator Who wrote the Bible. We say, “Man wrote It.” “Man of old, moved by the Holy Ghost, wrote It.” See? See, God wrote It through man. Like a prophet speaks His Word, it’s not the prophet’s word, it’s God’s Word, see, through the prophet. That’s the reason It has to come to pass, if it’s truly the Truth. Now, we see this great man. And, remember, Job had no Bible to read in his day. No! He only went by inspiration. He was a prophet to whom the Word of the Lord comes to. He had only to be inspired, because he knowed his position that he was God’s prophet. Now, the only thing that had to happen, was for the inspiration to strike him. And then he knowed what he said would happen, because it was by inspiration. That’s what the church, if it’s in order (set in order), it only … it’s got the mechanics ready, it only needs then the dynamics. Tonight, if we’ll get the mechanics ready, get our hearts right, the things that we can do, follow every Word, follow Him in baptism, follow Him in every order that He told us to do, get every mechanic ready, and stand there; then we’re ready for the dynamics to be lit off, and only God can do that; and that’s to drop into your heart that faith that says, “I am now healed.” Then don’t make any difference what circumstances is, you’re healed anyhow; ’cause it’s faith, by faith you’re healed. He had a channel of communication to God, that he’d got by inspiration. He had a way of moving himself out, and letting God move in. And he knowed he was justified. It was a gift, it was a gift for the people; not for Job, but for the people. That’s what all Divine gifts are, to serve God’s people with. Everybody’s not ordered to be a prophet. All of you not … is not ordered to be praying for the sick. All of them’s not ordered to be pastors, and so forth. But it’s a channel that God has opened to them. And is as we had this morning in the lesson, that he … One man has no business deviating in the next man’s channel, no matter how inspired, how much it seems, how well … How many was at the meeting this morning? Let’s see your hand. See? See, you cannot. There’s David, just as inspired as he could be, all the people shouting and glorifying God, for a reason that seemed exactly Scripture, but he was the wrong person. That inspiration should have come to Nathan, not David. See, he never even consulted Nathan. You see what happened? See, we have … God said He “does nothing till He reveals It to His servants the prophets.” And Job was this prophet in this day. Now, only thing God had done to Job: What always give him wisdom and His Word and inspiration, he could get no inspiration. But he knowed all of his mechanics (he had offered the burnt-offering, he had done everything he knowed to do was right), but he couldn’t get a word from God. But the devil couldn’t move him! There you are. Now, there you are when you’re prayed for. You don’t have to run back through a line, or go let somebody else pray for you. When you know you’ve done exactly what God told you to do, see, then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you, and, “Now I’m healed!” When it drops in there, then it’s all over. Oh, you don’t need no prayer lines, nothing else, it’s over! It’s been revealed to you! See? Just like the old prophet at the coming of the Lord Jesus, we find out it was revealed to him, the old sage, that “he would not see death until he seen the Lord’s Christ.” And he believed That, and he waited for It. And the people thought he was crazy, the old man had lost his mind. But he still believed It! Nothing could shake him from It, he knowed God had revealed It to him, for the Bible said, “It was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost.” Simeon coming into the Temple at that minute, walked over and give praise to God, and said, “Let Thy servant depart in peace.” When he picked up the baby, “Mine eyes have seen Thy salvation.” See, he knowed he was going to see It. No matter how many babies he’d visit each day, he knew God had revealed to him that he was going to see the Christ before he died. Simeon believed that. Now when it’s revealed to you, that you yourself has received God’s promise; the inspiration, you being Christians, it struck you, you don’t even need a prayer line. The thing … the only thing you need is a open heart when all the mechanics are ready, and let the inspiration drop in, and then nothing can change your mind; you’ve got it. Outside of that, it won’t do no good. Now notice, Job needed a channel of inspiration, he had it open. He had a channel to communicate with God, by His inspiration. He had a way of moving himself out and let the Word of God move in. Notice how they come to consult him from the East and from the West, people looking for him because they know that what Job said was the Truth. They knowed that man told the Truth. Because, what he prophesied, that’s what happened! And so people come from the East and West. He said he’d go over to the markets, the young princes from the East would bow before him, just to hear one word of consolation from him, his great and mighty wisdom, ’cause they knowed the man was honest. He didn’t want to boast up himself, he had no axes to grind, no strings to pull, he was just a honest prophet before God. And they had confidence in him, and everybody come from the East and West just to speak to him in a moment. He’s spoke of, in the Bible here. But, you see, he lacked inspiration to tell him what all this was about. God let it happen, didn’t tell him. Then, one day, we find out that in that, that’s the time that … Everybody, as long as you can help them, “All right.” But when they want to disagree with you, that’s when trouble comes in. But he alone knew he was right; his pulsation of faith, of hearing God’s Word speak to him, he knew It was the Truth. Yes, sir! He knew God’s Voice. Nobody could fool him on It, for he knew It. It … But whenever you … something’s revealed to you, maybe contrary to what the people think … Now, I’m speaking in the line of prophets. When it’s God reveals something, which, if there ever is a secret comes out from God to be made known to the people, it will never come through a seminary, it will never come through a group of people, it never did. It always will, has, and will, through one individual, a prophet! Amos 3:7, see, “The Lord does nothing except first He reveals It through His prophets.” And, now, Job had something wrong with him, but he couldn’t get the inspiration on him, and it was worrying him, and that … when you get in that kind of a fix, that’s when the enemy moves into every friend, nearly, you got. And they begin to accuse him. Oh, it must have been a miserable thing for him to know his friends that accused him, Satan then goes and joins himself with the enemy. That’s when Satan comes in, “Let me have him, and I’ll make him curse You to Your … I’ll make him deny his Message. I’ll make him curse You. I’ll make him go back and say ‘It was all wrong.’” Then he tried him with everything he could, to all the great man and the friends that he used to have. But Job stood flat-footed, for he knew he had heard God’s Voice! O God, help, tomorrow night, that I can get that Wings Of A Dove. See, I heard the Voice of God that said something, and it’s going to happen that way! Just the same as these other things has happened, it’s going to happen! Now, Job knew it was going to happen. And he knowed that God had told him that, that he was “just.” But they made him a sinner, so he waited then for the inspiration. Satan getting in all the people and he come around the … his comforters, the so-called, and accusing him, but it didn’t move him a bit. But when the Word of God became vindicated to him … He had heard of God by the hearing of the ear, but one day setting out at his lowest point … And while he was setting there, and everyone accusing him, even his wife telling him he was “wrong,” he was scraping his boils. And Elihu came down and rebuked him for being selfish, about the way he was accusing God and so forth. And then at that time it was when inspiration struck him, that’s when the lightning begin to flash, the thunders begin to roar, that’s when the inspiration struck the prophet, and he raised up, and he said, “I know my Redeemer liveth! And at the last days He’ll stand upon this earth. Though the skinworms destroys this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, Whom I shall see for myself.” He saw … He had been talking about the trees, the botany life, how it dies and lives again; water brings it back again, the smell of water, the scent of water, the results of water pouring upon a tree or something, a seed that went in the ground. He said, “But a man layeth down and giveth up the ghost, his children come to honor and he perceive it not. O that Thou would hide me in the grave” (Job 14) “till Thy wrath be past.” He said, “But if a man dies, shall he live again? All the appointed times of my life, I’ll wait till my change comes. Thou wilt call me, and I’ll answer. Thou hast appointed me bounds that I cannot pass,” so forth. He knowed all these things. He watched the tree live, but what happened to a man when he died? He didn’t raise up again. So, God was showing him this Redeemer. He wanted to see if there was somebody who could intercede for him. He had interceded for so many people, but now is there somebody can speak for him? Could there somebody put his hand on Job, or on a sinful man and a Holy God, and make bridge the way? Could he go to His house and knock at the door? Would He open the door and talk to him awhile? But, then, when the inspiration dropped into his heart, then he could see God. The lightning’s a-flashing, the thunder’s a-roaring. And when it did, he stood upon his feet, and he said, “I know my Redeemer liveth! My Redeemer, and at the last days He’ll stand on the earth.” See, he had begin to see God’s reaction to his faith. Now, we wonder if we could see God. Is there a way that we could see Him? Now, it was the only way God had, trying Job out. He said, “I have heard of Thee, with the hearing of the ear, but now I see Thee. But now I see Thee, with my eyes.” The vision of the invisible had been made plain. He seen the cloud rolling around, he heard the flashing of the lightning, or saw it. And seen the rolling of the thunder, maybe on a clear day, and he seen God was in that cloud and in that lightning. He could see God, with his natural eye. See, because the invisible was made visible. The visible vision of others was then vindicated, clear, to the natural eye. Just like faith with works, as we spoke on last night. Abraham, no … had no Bible to read either, but he was a prophet, his vision and his faith. And it seemed wrong to others that he should think that way, that he should think they was going to have a baby. But they did have the baby, because his vision of the baby was what he was talking about, “I’m going to have it! I’m going to have it!” But when the baby was borned, then the other people could see with the eye what he saw in a vision. And when you go to acting upon what you believe in your heart, then the people know God, and know what’s happening to you, by the way you act. That’s how you see God with the eye. But to him, all he had done that was good, all that he had done for others, he needed somebody to intercede for him. When the birth of the baby come, Isaac, the inspiration that had led him to this had vindicated his vision to where the people could see that what he had saw in a vision was actually the Truth. Now, sometimes these great pulsations of faith come right in the time of crisis. It’s usually crisis that drives us into this. It was a crisis that drove Job into it. Why, he was at the end of his life. His children was dead; his camels. And all of his goods was gone and destroyed. And his own life, he was broke out from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet with boils. It was a crisis, that he pressed hisself, there’s where the inspiration struck him. O men and women, tonight, if you could look around and see how close we are to the Coming of the Lord. You who’ve put off the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You maybe relied upon some sensation, or something that you done that Satan can impersonate, and can’t have the real Spirit in you to go all the way in God’s promises. How can a man that claims to have the Holy Ghost deny one Word of this Bible, being, “not right”? You can’t do it! No matter how religious you are, how many churches you belong to, how many books your name’s on, if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you (which is this Word manifested), you’ll see the Message and the hour, because it’s the Holy Ghost that does it. But there has to be something light that off, inspiration strike you. And if there’s … if you pour water on the ground, on the ground, on the ground, and there’s no seed in there to strike it, how can it ever bring forth anything? There’s nothing there to bring forth. That is, that only the Elected of God will see It. The Elected of God seen It in Noah’s time, Moses’ time, Jesus’ time, the apostles’ time, Luther’s time, Wesley’s time, Pentecostal time, because that was the Seed that was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out. Now while the inspiration’s poured out, to gather the Bride together, it’s only those who are Elected will see It. Jesus said, “I thank Thee, Father, that Thou hast hid these things from the eyes of the wise and prudent, and revealed It to babes such as learn.” Now, inspiration has to strike it. Now, when the inspiration struck him, that did it. He had It then! Now, we find out, there comes a time of these crisis when the press is right on. And you look around today, look at the condition we’re living in. Aren’t we living in a modern Sodom and Gomorrah? Hasn’t the world come back? That was a Gentile world that was destroyed then, by fire. Didn’t Jesus say, in St. Luke, the 17th chapter, the 28th, 29th, and 30th verse, that, “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man is being revealed”? What is a “revealed”? Is a secret made known, a revelation; is to reveal or make known a secret. Now, these things that’s been hid all through the church ages is now being revealed, made known. Now, we could say that, and if God didn’t back that up, that’s wrong. See, God don’t need anybody to interpret His Word, He’s His Own interpreter. He said, “A virgin shall conceive,” and she did. He said, “Let there be light,” and there was. And we are not living in Luther’s age, Wesley age, or the Pentecostal age. The Pentecostal age was only a restoration of the gifts coming back to the church, but we’re living in the evening time, we’re living in a time of the calling out of the Bride. And just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther, and the Luther’s to see the Wesley, and the Penteco- … the Wesley’s to see the Pentecostal age, so is it hard for the Pentecostals to see this age. It’s always been that way, because It’s poured out upon an Elected Seed, and that only. That’s what the Bible teaches. They can’t see It, Jesus even prayed for them, said, “They was blind, they didn’t know it.” Revelation tells us, in this Laodicean church age, when He was put out of the church, that they’re “naked! poor! miserable! blind! and don’t know it.” Back again, they can’t see It, can’t understand It. They’re so creeped up in traditions! But remember the promised Word of God by the mouth of Jesus Christ, the very God that spoke creation into existence, He was the One before the foundation of the world that spoke the Words, “And let there be,” and there was. For He said, “He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. But as many as did know Him, to them He gave the power to become the sons of God.” The very Creator, and the very Creator Himself, when He raised up Lazarus from the dead, He said, “Think this not strange, for the hour’s coming that when all that’s in the grave will hear the Voice of the Son of man, and shall come out.” The very God that said “Let there be Light,” said “The Voice of the Son of man would wake those that are in the grave.” It has to happen in its season. He spoke, “Let there be male and female,” and so forth, and all this, years and hundreds of years before it happened. The inspiration hit the prophet Isaiah, he said, “Unto us a child is born, a son is given. His Name shall be called Counselor, Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father.” Years passed, months, years, days, weeks, years rolled by, hundreds of years rolled by. Eight hundred years later, Emmanuel was borned by a virgin! Why? Is because it was spoke by the lips of God’s anointed prophet, a seed went forth. See? “And that great hour,” said, “will you seek … ask Me of a vision or a sign.” He said, “I’ll give them a sign, an everlasting sign, ‘A virgin shall conceive,’ an everlasting sign.” Now, we find that in those hours of real stress, that’s usually when the Spirit of God moves in. He let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace, before He ever moved a hand. But when He moved, He moves. Now, we notice here that in Luke, the 17th chapter, and the 30th verse, that He said, “In the last days, that the Son of man would reveal Himself as He did just before Sodom and Gomorrah, and the same conditions would exist.” He told about Moses, about … and I beg your pardon, not about Moses, but about Noah. How that the people was “eating, drinking, and so forth, marrying and given in marriage.” Then He come around, He said, “Now, as it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be at the time when the Son of man is being revealed.” Now, watch, the Son of man was revealed to Abraham’s group, as a man, a prophet in a form of human flesh, a ordinary man with dust on His clothes, and Abraham called Him “Elohim.” Now, Jesus promises here that in the last days the Son of man will be revealed again to that same type of group, the royal Seed of Abraham, just before the fire falls. Remember, the church never received any more witness, Abraham and them didn’t, the promised son that they were looking for was brought right away after that. And the church is looking for the Promised Son, He will come right after the days of this ministry, He’ll be revealed from the heavens. Now, we see it too plain, it’s got to be. Now, the only thing there has to be is something pulsates, gets into a man, God vindicate and tells him and shows him that that is the thing to happen; and that you’re going to … Like Moses did, he didn’t want to deliver those children, but God spoke to him in a burning bush. He didn’t want to go, but he had to go. Moses had heard of Him being the great Jehovah. But then he could see Him, He was in the form of a Pillar of Fire. “I’ve heard of Thee, but now I see Thee.” What was He seen in? His Word vindicated. God told Abraham that “his people would sojourn in a strange land for four hundred years, but He would bring them out with a mighty hand.” And, notice, this burning bush gave vindication to what the prophet Abraham had said would take place. Moses said, “I’ve heard of it, but now I see it!” Now, we’ve heard that in the last days that the Son of man will come among His people and reveal Himself to the people in the same way that He did at the … just before the destruction of Sodom. The Son of man, what did He do? He knowed the secrets that was in Sarah’s heart. Also give the promise to Abraham. Abraham had heard God’s Voice, he might have seen Him in many different ways (I don’t know how He talked to him, through dreams or through prophecies), but this time he saw Him. “I’ve heard of You, now I see You.” And the church has heard of God, they’ve read of Him, and what He did, and the promises He made, but now we see Him with our eyes (just the same as Job did), “I’ve heard of Thee, but now I see Thee.” My! What a different. Moses, in that crisis, cried out. And we find out, in Exodus, the 14th chapter, the 13th and to the 16th verse, Moses in that great strain there with the children of Israel, inspiration struck him, and he said what he was supposed to say, not knowing he said it. See, “Stand still and see the salvation of God.” God had never spoke to him yet. See, the inspiration struck him. They said, “Why did you bring us out here? We ought to have died in Egypt. Was because there was no graves down there? Bring us out here, and let us die; we could have lived in peace as slaves until we died, but you brought us out here.” Moses, a prophet, knowing he had access to God, was inspired, and he said, “Stand still and you’ll see the salvation of God; for the Egyptians you’re looking at today, you’ll never see them again.” How did he know it was going to happen? How did he know? He didn’t know what he spoke. But as immediately after he spoke it, God told him how to do it. Said, “Moses, don’t cry to Me, take your staff in your hand and stretch it out over the sea, and tell the children of Israel to ‘Walk!’” Amen! The inspiration! That’s the way it strikes you if you’re sick. That’s the way it strikes you if you’re afflicted. Something’s revealed to you, and you see that it’s been revealed, you speak up, “I’m healed!” Then God tells you what to do, “Rise up and start walking.” Amen! Then it’s all over, when you can do it that way. That’s the way God does it, then you see God manifested through yourself. It was God that told him to do it. Now, then, all that was present, all of Israel that was present saw the inspiration that struck Moses. They seen God, with their own eye, blow that water back from one side to the other. And that Pillar of Fire led them right across the sea. He heard of God, then they seen God. Joshua was in a hour of crisis, when the armies was routed, and the sun was going down. Joshua was a prophet, and he knew that if them armies ever had a chance to unite again and come against him, he would lose more man, so in that hour of crisis when something had to be done … There’s only one thing, if he could keep them running, he’d route them, every one, down. But there wasn’t enough light to do it, so Joshua stood, raised his hands, he said, “Sun, stand still! And moon, hang over Ajalon till I get through with this battle.” And the sun stood still. They heard Joshua speak, and then they seen God, with their own eyes, in action. True! See, of course, it was a paradox to see something that seems to be impossible, yet it’s true. But, “The sun stood still,” says the Bible. I don’t know what you people think, that thinks the world was run, now; but, anyhow, “the sun stood still.” Perhaps Joshua never had tried to figure out how he was going to do it, how God was going to do it, the only thing that he said was, “Sun stand still!” He said it, perhaps not knowing what he was saying, because it was God that give it to him, and He worked. Same thing in Mark 11:23, “If you say to this mountain ‘be moved,’ and don’t doubt in your heart, but believe that what you said will come to pass, you can have what you said.” But you can’t stand there fumble in your mind and say it, you’ve got to be inspired to say it. Amen! Excuse the expression; but that day, setting there in that woods (and God’s my judge, and I could fall dead on this pulpit), when that Scripture had stumped me all my life … setting there that morning in the woods, and I was thinking on that, and that Voice spoke to me, He said, “That Scripture is like all Scriptures, It’s true.” And I thought, “Well, how could it be?” And He said, “You’re … ” I said … He said, “Speak, and it will be that way. Don’t doubt It.” And I was talking to Somebody, setting way out in the woods. No squirrels, been there for three days, there’s no squirrels there. And I was setting in a sycamore thicket. Squirrels don’t even come … anyone that hunt squirrels, know they’re not in sycamore. And I had been setting there; and wind blowing real hard, about ten o’clock in the morning, and I was thinking again. And It said, “You’re hunting, and you need squirrels just the same as Abraham needed a ram.” I thought, “That’s always told me the Truth, but this sounds funny.” And I got up from where I was setting, looked all around, “Where is that Person that was talking to me?” Nothing; wind just blowing real hard. And I thought, “Could I have fell asleep and dreamed that? No, I wasn’t asleep. I was setting up against the tree there, watching, supposed to pick up Brother Woods and Brother Sothmann back there, just in a little bit, around ten o’clock in the morning. Farmers all out there working, gathering their corn.” And I heard It again, say, “You are hunting, and you need game. How many do you need?” And I thought, “Now, I don’t want to overdo this, I’m just going to ask for three, three squirrels. I want young, three red squirrels. I want them.” He said, “Then speak about it.” And I said, “I am going to get three young red squirrels.” He said, “Which a-way will they come?” “Well,” I thought, “I’ve went this far, there’s Something talking to me here.” Just the same as you hear me talking. And God in Heaven, with this Bible over my heart, knows that that’s true. And He … And I said, “Well, … ” I picked out a ridiculous place, an old dry limb hanging out of there (about fifty yards, where my rifle was shot in). I said, “The first one will be right there,” and there he was. I rubbed my eyes and looked back (I turned my head), and I thought, “I don’t want to shoot a vision.” So I looked around again, and there set the squirrel. I throwed a shell up in my gun, aimed up, and I could see his black eye, young red squirrel. I thought, “I … maybe I’m sleeping, I’ll wake up in a few minutes. See, I’m dreaming about this.” Well, I leveled down, shot the squirrel and it dropped off the limb. I thought, “Well, I don’t know.” I thought, “Well, should I go over and look for it?” And I walked over there, and there it laid. I picked it up and blood run out of it. A vision don’t bleed, you know. So I picked it up, and it was a squirrel. I got real numb, all over. And I looked around, I said, “God, that was You!” I said, “Thank You, for this. Now I’ll go out and … ” He said, “But you said! Do you doubt what you said? You said you’d get ‘three.’ Now where will the next one come from?” I thought, “Well, if I’m dreaming, I’m going to continue on.” So I said … I picked out an old post over there, of a tree that was all wrapped up with this here poison ivy. You never get a squirrel in that. So I said, “The next one will come right out of that poison ivy,” and there set that young red squirrel looking right at me. I set my gun down, and rubbed my eyes. Turned around again, I thought … There he set, turned his head sideways. I shot the squirrel, and then I started to go home. But said, “You said ‘three’! Do you doubt what you said?” I said, “No, Lord, I don’t doubt what I said, for You’re confirming.” This is one Scripture that stumped me: “Not if I say, but if you say.” Not if Jesus said it, but if you say it yourself. And I thought, “Somehow I’ve broke into that channel, and I know He’s here because I’m almost beside myself.” I thought, “I’ll make this one ridiculous, sure enough.” I said, “They’d be a, red squirrel come down off that hill, come right down this way, and right by me, and go out, and set on that limb, and look down there at that farmer.” Here he come down the hill, went right out, and sat, looked at the farmer. And I shot him. Satan said to me, “You know what? The woods is just full of them, now.” And I set there till twelve o’clock, and not another thing happened. It goes to show that when God … He’s the very Creator of Heavens and earth! Listening in, in Jeffersonville now, there’s a family named Wright. Brother Woods and I went down to see them. They make the communion wine for the church. Little Edith was setting there in the room; a little crippled girl, that she had been sick all of her life, and so we had always looked to God to heal her. Her sister, a widow, her husband had been killed; her name was Hattie, very humble little woman. And while Brother Banks and I went out to get her a rabbit, they had cooked a big cherry cobbler; and made me set down and eat. We was all setting around the table, we were talking about this, it just happened a few days before. And while setting around the table, talking about this, all at once I said, “What could have happened?” I said, “Brother Wright, you’re an old man, hunted squirrels all your life. Brother Shelby, you’re an expert squirrel hunter. Brother Woods, so are you. I’ve hunted them since a kid. Did you ever see a squirrel in a sycamore and locust thicket?” “No, sir.” I said, “They just wasn’t there.” I said, “The only thing I know, It’s just the same God. When Abraham needed a ram, He was Jehovah-jireh, He could ‘provide for Himself.’” I said, “I believe it’s the same thing.” And little ol’ Hattie setting back there, said, “Brother Branham, that’s nothing but the Truth!” She said the right thing! When she said that, the Holy Spirit dropped over in that channel again, every one of them felt It. I raised up, I said, “Sister Hattie, THUS SAITH THE LORD, you said the right word like the Syrophenician woman said. The Holy Spirit’s speaking to me now, and said for me to give you the desire of your heart.” I said, “Now, if I be God’s servant, if it is, it’ll happen. If I ain’t God’s servant, then I’m a liar, and it won’t happen, I’m a deceiver.” I said, “Now try and see, it’s the Spirit of God or not.” She said, “Brother Branham,” (everybody was crying), said, “what shall I ask?” I said, “You got a crippled sister setting there.” I had twenty dollars in my pocket, to give to her, that she had put in a donation. The woman don’t make a capital of about two hundred dollars a year, on that little, old, poor farm, her and two boys. Her boys had got to be regular ‘Ricky’s,’ school days, you know, and just sassing their mother; and fifteen, sixteen years old. And, oh, they were standing over there laughing at what I was saying. And I said, “You’ve got a father and mother setting here that’s old. You haven’t got any money. Ask for the money, and see if it comes in your lap. Ask for your sister, and see if she don’t get up and walk.” I knew then, like Job, there’s just something you know when you strike it. Said, “I know! Here I stand before about ten people,” I said, “if this doesn’t happen, then I’m a false prophet.” Said, “What shall I ask?” I said, “It’s up to you to make your decision. I cannot make your decision.” She looked around, the little woman. And all at once, she said, “Brother Branham, the greatest desire in my heart is the salvation of my two boys.” I said, “I give you your boys, in the Name of Jesus Christ.” And them snickering, laughing, fun making boys fell across their mother’s lap, and surrendered their life to God, and was filled with the Holy Ghost right then. Why? That is Truth! God has the authority to kill me, before these people across the nation. Many of you here and in Jeffersonville, I can hear the tabernacle ring out now, “Amen!” because they’re setting right there listening at it. See, because it’s the Truth! What is it? It’s when the God, by His sovereign grace; it happens! Outside of there, it won’t happen. In that crucial moment … Think of the men and the people that I’m acquainted with. God bypassing all the celebrities, and everything, to give a poor, little ol’ humble woman, can’t hardly sign her own name; and He knowed that what she’d ask for. And that was the greatest thing; for her sister is now dead, and her mother and father has to die, the money would’ve perished, but the souls of her boy is Eternal! And that was the hour for them to catch It. And just as soon as I said, “I give you your boys, in the Name of Jesus Christ,” there they fell across their mother’s lap. How many in here knows that to be Truth, you know it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] See? That’s right. Yes. Why? Inspiration! Now: “I have heard of Thee, that Thou could create squirrels; I’ve heard of Thee, that Thou could create a ram; but now I see Thee, with mine own eye!” The manifestation, the vision made visible. When God promised anything, that’s what He’ll do. Notice, when you have a need, perhaps like Joshua. He had a need; he never thought of the circumstances, he spoke it, and it was God! Do you believe the sun stood still? So do I. How did it do it? Don’t try to figure it out, but it did it. Joshua did it, and raised his hands; in that crucial moment he had access to God, and that’s what happened. It was timely. The Spirit of the Living God had seen the need of it, and pushed upon Joshua to say it. The same God seen the need of Abraham. The same God seen the need of confirming this Scripture to me, that that Scripture’s true, too! The same God seen the need of those two predestinated boys, and it was that moment He proved it and confirmed His Word. St. Mark 14, we see a woman believed on Him, she had had need and seen He had need for His feet to be washed, she had only to be inspired to go into action. Now listen close as … before we close. She only had to be inspired to go into action, because she had already heard about Him. She heard that “He forgive a woman of her sins, a harlot. And said, ‘Which one of you is without sin? Cast the first stone.’” She had heard about Him, but now she seen Him. She was inspired to serve Him. That’s the only thing you have to be. Let the Holy Spirit tell you that “You’re a sinner!” Let the Holy Spirit tell you “You’re wrong!” Let the Holy Spirit prove to you by the Scriptures that “You’re Scripturally wrong! And what … ’cause It’ll only stir through one straight channel of every Scripture of God, It won’t bypass for nothing. If you do, It’ll never do you any good. Because the Holy Spirit can inspire It to you, but if the soul isn’t right with God, as we’ve been through this week, it’s no good anyhow. Remember, false anointed-ones will rise in the last days; not false Jesuses, false christs (anointed ones), and will deceive the very Elected if it were possible. Notice, she had a service to do for Him. She had heard of Him, now she seen Him with her eyes. She had a service to do, and she had nothing to do it with. So she rushed forward anyhow, to do the service, God furnished the water and towels to wash His feet. She had heard of a Living God, all of her life, but now she seen Him with her eyes. She knew it was Him, and inspiration struck her, and said, “This is the Messenger!” He needed a service (she had nothing to serve Him by), His feet was dirty. But she rushed forward anyhow, to do Him a service, because she was inspired to do it. O the backslidden church member, denominational man or woman, can’t you see the need Jesus has tonight? If inspiration can only strike you, this is the hour to do it. But she seen Him with her eyes. The others there were even mocking Him. They didn’t believe His Message. Frankly, the host, the pastor-host, ol’ Simon, had got Him down there to make fun out of Him. They didn’t believe He was a prophet. So then when it seemed like the devil had worked it just right in for him to say this, he said in hisself, “If this man was a prophet, he would know what kind of a woman that was at his feet. If he was a prophet!” See, it wasn’t even revealed to him who He was. There couldn’t be any inspiration strike him, ’cause there’s nothing there to strike to. But it was struck to her! Her eyes had seen beyond his criticism. She believed He was, see, the Word of the prophets. She knowed that That was all the Words of the prophets, was vindicated in Him. She had heard He was on earth, but now she sees Him. Watch what she done. She seen the Word made flesh, the Messiah, the Emmanuel. When she gave vent to her pulsation of faith (of revelation of Who He was, in the time she was living, that He was God’s Lamb for such sinners as she was), she went forth to serve His needs without knowing how she would do it. That’s the way a genuine healing comes, when it’s revealed to you that “He was wounded for your transgressions, bruised for your iniquity, and with His stripes you were healed.” When it’s inspired to you to see His Presence here, of Saint Mark 11 … or Saint Luke 17:30, that He’s going to reveal Hisself in the last days (among His people, in human flesh) like He did before Sodom. When you see that, and something strikes you! The doctor might say, “The cancer’s still there.” The patient might say, “I don’t know how I’m going to walk, but I’m going to walk anyhow.” We don’t know how it’s going to do. She went forward to serve Him, because inspiration struck Him … struck her, that that was the hour, that was the Messenger, that was the Messiah who was to heal, and she believed It. And He needed a service done to Him, and she went forward without anything showing that she could do it. She just went upon her inspiration. Watch! God broke up the fountains of the tear glands in her eyes. The same eyes that had heard … ears that had heard Him; the eyes that seen It, broke up with joy. Then that other, God-given long hair, with them tears flowing down. God furnished her towels (with her hair), and with her tears. She served His needs, the need of the Living God. She had heard about It, but now she seen Him, she could do Him a service. O sinner! Why don’t you do likewise as you see the needs now? That He needs you, your service! Now you see the One, Who once you heard about in the Bible. We seen Him last night come in here, and what He done. We see Him, meeting after meeting, and sometimes we set just as cold and indifferent, say, “Yes, I know the Scripture says it. Oh, I’ve seen it done, see.” We have no enthusiasm, it don’t seem to strike us right. There don’t seem to be something, like if you was pouring … Taking a match and striking it, if the match hasn’t got the sulfur right on the head of the match, it cannot strike. And you can rake and rake and rake, but if some chemical has killed the sulfur on there, it will not strike, there’ll be no light. But if that chemical, the sulfur to strike against the metal will … it’s still on there when it strikes, it’ll light. And when the true, genuine vindication of the Scriptures of this last-day Message, and you see the Presence of Jesus Christ, that you had heard what He done in His life, and hearing the Scriptures say “He’s the same yesterday, today and forever”; and just before the Sodom condition is fired-over with the wrath of God, see Jesus return amongst His people, formed in human flesh, and do the same thing He done. My! It ought to strike our souls to Glory! It ought to do something to us. Why? It’s dropping on that. You heard in the Bible what He did, how the woman touched His garment. He turned around and told her what her trouble was, and her faith made her whole. Now, He promised that He would do that same thing again, just before the world would be burnt, and the world would be in a Sodom condition. The New Testament, the Prophet, the God-Prophet, the Prophet of prophets, the God of all the prophets, the fullness of the Godhead bodily, God of … manifested in a flesh, the Creator, of Genesis. Hallelujah! It’s His Word! He said it would happen! And we see Sodom condition, we see the world in that condition, now we see Him come down and do exactly what He said He would do. Now, we’ve heard of Him, now we see Him! “I’ve heard of You with my ears, now I see You with my eyes.” Amen! “I see Him with my own eyes.” What a hour it should be! What a time it should be! The confirmation of His Word! Always when the Word is confirmed, that’s God speaking in His Word, making Hisself visible that you can see. Now, here’s a little ol’ prostitute off the street, she falls at the altar, before Jesus, and she washed His feet with the tears, and wiped them with her hair. God honored, He said, “Wherever this Gospel is being preached, let this be told for a memorial to her.” Why? Look how filthy she was, but something struck. She seen the Word of the promise, from the Garden of Eden, this, “woman’s Seed shall bruise the serpent’s head.” She seen the Messiah that had been borned of a virgin. She heard He was to be borned of a virgin, but they heard that man was on earth. She heard there was a young rabbi, Prophet, who healed the sick. She believed that! And here she come down the street, walking around, looking around. And she looked over there and seen that great party going on. She slipped up to the fence, and looked through, and there He was. There He was! Something said, “That’s Him!” See, that’s all she needed to be inspired. See what happened? She seen the Word of God made flesh. She had heard with her ear, now she saw with her eyes. Now, everybody knows that we have a promise of the church condition, in the last day. The church, in its present condition, can never fulfill the commandments of God, the great commission, could never call the Bride out. Which one would do it? The Pentecostal’s? I should say not. None of the rest of them. That’s the shuck that’s on the wheat. That come out, looked just exactly like the wheat, but there was no wheat to it. It opens up, but the grain comes out of that. They organize, they kill themselves. There’s where they die. They’re stalks. But the wheat has come up through there, and now it’s begin to form in the Bride-form. The corn of wheat that fell into the ground through the dark ages, it had to die. That critic saying, “Why would a God of mercy, could open up the Red Sea, stand let them poor Christians be eat up with lions, and burnt, and everything? Set up, just like He laughed about it!” The poor ignoramus! Did he not know, “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground”? It had to die through those dark ages, like any other corn of wheat has to go beneath the earth and be buried, to bring forth in the first reformation them two blades of Luther, the stalk. It had to come forth in the Wesleyans, out yonder, to bring forth the pollen, the tassels, the great missionary age. Had to come forth in the Pentecostal, for the restoration of the gifts, almost to deceive the very Elected. Looks like a wheat grain; open it up, there’s no wheat there at all, it’s only shuck. But back in there, then, they begin to form the oneness organization, the trinity organization, the twoness organization, and church of God organization, and all organized, and just death exactly! And now what happens? But it’s a shelter for the wheat, it’s been growing through it all the time. Now it’s begin to pull away, the wheat’s begin to be seen. This is not a Pentecostal age. This is the latter-day age. This is the Bride age. This is the evening Light. This is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled, to follow God’s pattern. This is Luke 17:30, to be fulfill. This is the second … And Jeremiah, and all the rest of them, that Joel has spoke of these days, this is that day. “I have heard, Lord, and It was coming, but now I see It with my eye.” Though many … how many false impersonators rise, them Jannes and Jambres with all their gimmicks to do everything that Moses did, never shook him or Aaron at all. They knowed where … like Job, they knowed Who their inspiration come from. They knowed It was THUS SAITH THE LORD! And the same Bible that spoke of them, said, “They’d come in the last days, impersonators.” Those religious denominations, when something started … Who started first? Moses or them? If they had started first, Moses would have been the mimic. Now we got all kinds of discerners and everything else that’s trying to throw your mind from the genuine thing of God, which God has proven to be the Truth by His Scripture. “We’ve heard of It with our ears, now we see It with our eye.” Amen! Do you believe It? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] All our hearts! Inspiration! And in that day when the Son of man is being revealed, a Son of man, Jesus Christ made manifest amongst His people. A man walked down there before Abraham and his group, just an ordinary-looking Man, dust on His clothes. He had his back turned to the tent, He said, “Where is your wife Sarah?” (not S-a-r-r-a, S-a-r-a-h; A-b-r-a-h-a-m, not A-b-r-a-m). Called his name, said, “Where is she?” Said, “She’s in the tent, behind You.” Said, “I’m going to visit you according to the time of life” (and she laughed up her sleeve). Said, “Why did she laugh?” (Uh-huh). Now, He promised. Them people was the one that was looking for a promised son. Now, I don’t care how much the people act in these denominations, that they’re “looking for Christ,” their actions prove they’re not. That’s right. Your actions speaks louder than your words. All they’re thinking about is making denominational members, but there are some people, one here and there, that’s looking for the Coming of the Lord. They’re watching for … though. Only those will He reveal Himself to, only those will understand. Just the Elected understood Who He was. Just think, there’s about maybe three million people, Jews, on earth, there wasn’t one third of them ever knowed He was there till He had done come and gone. See? But He revealed Himself to those who were waiting: John the Baptist, and the apostles that had been called by John, and so forth, and blind Anna in the temple, Simeon the priest that “it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost that he was going to see the Christ.” All those great religious leaders, theologians and things, blind as they could be! Only can the rain raise the seed, if the seed’s already there. And as you was a germ first in your father, and he didn’t know you, yet you were in your father. But through a bedding ground of your mother, you were made manifest in his likeness, and then he could talk to you. God, the Great God; if you’ve got Eternal Life, then the germ of Eternal Life was in God at the beginning. And you were there, you were in His thinking, your name and all. And He, by foreknowledge, ordained you to see This. And you that was not ordained, will never see It. But, remember, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, “The hour is here!” Won’t you believe Him? Give your lives to Him. I have to stop, it’s after nine. Let’s bow our heads. “I have heard, Lord, of Thee, now I see Thee!” Lord Jesus, bless this people as they wait. Now I’m going to ask you a question. I’m going to let the Holy Spirit (I trust that He will) search out your minds, try you, try your soul, and see if you really believe. And if you find there’s a little bit of doubt there, will you raise your hand? Say, “Lord Jesus, let me see You. I’ve heard of You, but I’ve never really seen You. Let me see You, I’ll believe.” All right. That’s fine. Is there some here that doesn’t know Him as your Saviour? Raise your hand, say, “If … I’m a sinner, but if I … if You’ll just let me see You, Lord Jesus, manifest this Word that they’re talking about. I know that that’s how Job seen You. I know that’s how Abraham saw You. I know that’s how all the rest of them saw You, because it was Your promised Word being vindicated. I’ve heard all kinds of things, and gimmicks, and everything, but I understand that there’s a last-day Message in the land, that was spoke of by an Angel on the river, in 1933. I heard of the healing services going forth, and I know when that takes place, it can’t stay in that same old denominational rut.” It wasn’t sent for that, never did stay there. [Blank spot on tape.] …?… What if Moses would’ve come, said, “Let’s build an ark like Noah did, float out of Egypt down the river”? Oh, no. See? No! He had a Message from God, he was the manifestation. That prophet arising on the scene, ought to have proved to Israel right there. They hadn’t had a prophet for four hundred years, they hadn’t had a prophet, and here a prophet rises on the scene. They ought to have knowed that something was going to happen. Israel again hadn’t had a prophet for hundreds of years, and here come Jesus on the scene. And the woman at the well, said, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Now, we haven’t had one for four hundred years.” Because, He knowed what was in her heart. See? Now, we’re promised a church age through reformers, and we’ve had them. But He promised, in Malachi 4, He’d keep His pattern in the last days, what would take place, “To turn the hearts of the children back to the Faith of the apostolic father.” For that very purpose! And the church is so broke up in denominations and isms, it’s so tore to pieces till it’s dead; it’s been a carrier. And then He promised, in the hour of the seventh angel’s Message, the Seven Seals would be revealed; and the mysteries of God would be declared (Revelation 10) when the seventh angel begins to sound his Message, not the healing service, the Message that follows the healing service. Jesus was a “great guy” as long as He could heal the sick. But He said when, “I and My Father are One.” “Huh-uh! That was wrong!” Job was “great,” till something happened to him. See? It’s always that way. Believe! Will you accept Him now? Raise your hand, say, “I do believe Him. I want to accept Him.” God bless you. God bless you. That’s fine. Now set real still and pray just a moment. Dear God, in this solemn moment, it’s going to be a time like this when there really will be a clap of thunder someday, and the Son of God shall descend from the heavens with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and the trump of God, the dead in Christ shall rise. And each one of us knows and are aware tonight, Father, that we’re going to have to answer for every word we give, and every word we say. Even the thoughts that’s in our hearts, we’re going to answer for it. I pray Thee, God, in Jesus’ Name, that You’ll cleanse every heart that’s in here. Cleanse my heart, cleanse the hearts of this people. And may we be prepared, Lord, and may our spiritual eyes be opened tonight to see the Glory of Almighty God. We have heard of Him, O Father, God, we pray that You’ll let us see Him. Grant it, Father. Grant these blessings, I pray, through Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. Remember: In your heart, where you’re setting, make your little altar. Say, “Lord Jesus, come into my heart now. Give me something to … something I can hold to. Let me feel that inspiration that tells me that You’re ‘present.’” Now, what a statement to make to people! What a thing to do! Now I’m going to ask the Lord God, ask … How many of you take the tapes? You heard of: What Time Is It, Sirs? Did we show those magazines and things, a year before it happened? Science is stumped on it. There was the Lord Jesus crowned and with that white wig on as you see in the Bible, in Revelation 1, and the Daniel, Supreme Judge of Heaven and earth. Right there, when science can’t even see It themselves. And in the observatory, out there in the University of Arizona and down through Mexico, they’re searching, have been for the last two years. And there it was told you, it was “going to happen,” before. How about the Alaskan earthquake? Watch Hollywood fall into the sea! Watch and see if it doesn’t. He’s never told me anything wrong yet, it’ll do it. See? And just watch and see if we’re not living in the closing hours of history. No man knows what hour He’s coming. But I know one thing: I believe, in my present condition, if I’m in my right mind, and if I wasn’t a Christian, I’d sure want to be a real Bible Christian, not a denominational. Don’t rely upon ’cause you’ve shouted. We heard that this morning, proved it by the Word of God; it’s altogether out of the will of God, didn’t do a thing but cause death. Don’t be in the stalk, be in the Life. See? Have faith in God. Do you believe that the God that made this promise, that did appear Himself, in the Book of Genesis, and appeared to Abraham and performed that miracle … That same God was made flesh, human flesh, borned of a virgin. That was a theophany there, of course, but then when He come in human flesh and was the same man, and performing the same things, … Don’t you believe that if God could get a person, that He promised to do according to Malachi 4, a channel that He could speak through, He’ll perform the same thing He said He’d do there? Do you believe that? I believe He would, too. Do you believe that you could have the faith to touch His garment, His faith to touch the garment? Do you believe present now that something’s speaking to your heart that would tell you that you have faith to touch His garment? You believe you could do that? You reach up and touch with your faith then, not with emotion, just with absolutely pure, unadulterated faith. Just say, “Lord, I believe. I believe with all my heart. I want You to touch me ’cause I’ve heard You done it, now I want to see it with my own eyes.” And I can’t touch you. It takes God to do the touching. Do you believe He will do it? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] I’m looking right back to my left here. It seems like there’s a channel, kind of, as I’ve spoke, pulling that way. Being I’ve directed it that way, now it comes in wonderful. It’s a lady setting there with her husband. She’s not from here. She’s from Texas, Dallas. She’s suffering, also her husband’s suffering. She’s suffering from a complication, she’s had an operation. That’s right. Her husband suffers something with his back, back trouble. Mr. and Mrs. Corbet, from Texas; Dallas, Texas. If that’s so, raise up your hand. I’m a stranger to you. Is that right? No way in the world for me to know that. What is it? “I have heard of Thee by the ear, now I see Thee.” See what I mean? Now ask that couple. I never seen them in my life. “I have heard of Thee with the ear, now I see Thee with my eye.” If you can believe, God can furnish what you have need of. That man setting there with his hand up on his chin, with that high blood pressure. You believe God would make you well, sir? You do? Setting with your hand like this, you believe God will heal you of that high blood pressure? Raise up your hand, if you believe It. All right, He does it. I never seen the man in my life, I know nothing about him. But you heard that Jesus said, here in the Bible, that He would do these things, now you see it! You see what I mean? “If thou canst believe, all things are possible.” Only to them that believe! It takes real, genuine faith to do it. But if you can believe It, God will grant it. There’s a lady setting right back there, looking at me, got a goiter in her throat. Lady setting next by, setting next to her, that she’ll understand, that lady there has high blood pressure, also. That’s right. Lady setting next to her, she has a trouble, too. And she’s not from here, she’s from Arkansas. They’re missing it. Miss Phillips, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be healed! Do you believe Him? With all your heart? You accept It? Right. Then you can have it. Now you say, “That’s mysterious.” No! No! Jesus said, “Your name is Simon, you’re the son of Jonas.” Is that right? “I have heard of Thee with my ear, now I see Thee with my eye.” Now don’t you see what happened? Someone just setting there, looking, believing, trusting, and all at once there it happens. See? Feeling better, son, tonight, than you did last night? Setting down? It’s all right now, you’re going to be well (uh-huh). Setting here last night, butting his head and everything else; now, tonight, he looks like a gentleman. See? He was a little bit confused about things, but it’s all straightened out now. See? It’ll sbe all right. See? “And in that day, the Son of man is being revealed, see, just before Sodom is to be burned.” “I have heard of Thee with my ear, now I see Thee with my eye. I heard Jesus Christ say He promised that, I see that promise living right now.” See? “I have heard of Thee with my ear, now I see Him with my eye.” How many believes That to be Him? (O God!) Now, while we’re here … it’s getting late. Tomorrow night we’re going to have a great healing service. We’re expecting Brother Moore and I to stand here and pray for every person that wants to come through the line. But I thought in speaking this tonight, I was just going to make the altar call. But then I thought, “no,” It said there, “I have heard of Thee with the ear, now I want to see You with my eye.” Now He’s here. Do you believe that? Now let’s lay our hands over on one another. Now, remember, the same One that promised He would do this, said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” Did He say It? Are you a believer? Say, “Amen.” Well, then, the same God that made this promise that you see Him perform just now, … Ask any of those people, I never seen them, know nothing about them. I wouldn’t know them right now, see, impossible for me to. But that Scripture’s got to be fulfilled! Well, if that’s fulfilled, it shows we’re in the latter times, we’ll know the Son of man is ready to be … to come, because He’s revealing Himself in human flesh. Is that right? Then we know it’s true, and you say you’re a believer on Him, and you got your hands laid on one another. And if your hands are laid on one another, that same Son of God which is here to make this come true to your eyes, the same Son is here to say, “They shall recover!” The same Son of God! “I heard that He said, ‘If the believers lay their hands on, they shall recover.’ I heard it with my ears, now let me see it with my eyes. He promised to do it.” Now while I pray, you pray. Lord Jesus, in the Name of the Lord God of Heaven, let Your Spirit drop into these people’s heart; that genuine faith of God, that will confirm this promise to them. And may the God of Heaven heal every one of them, as they obey Your commandments by laying hands on each other. Let it be so, Lord. In the Name of Jesus Christ, grant that it will be so, for Your glory. Now, do you believe that you got what you asked for? Does something in your heart tell you? Do you feel that little speck of inspiration, said, “Why, it’s over! It’s done!”? The commandment of God said that we could hear it with our ear, now we can see it with our eye. Job said, “I’ve heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now I see Thee with my eyes.” Now, you heard it by the Word, by the hearing of the Word, “Faith cometh by hearing, hearing the Word.” Now you see It act, with your eyes! Now, that same God that said that, when these things was to be taking place, that “the believers on This would lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover.” Now has it dropped into your heart that you’re “healed”? Raise your hands if it did. Amen! That’s real apostolic healing. You mean it? You believe It with all your heart? Hallelujah! That’s all we need. Let’s stand on our feet and give Him praise, then. Thank You, Lord Jesus. Blessed be the Name of the Lord. I will praise Him! will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain. Now, do you love Him? Now let’s, all together, give Him glory, all ye people. Now, look, if that has been revealed to you by God, in the channel that you were saved in, the same channel that told you “you were saved,” the same channel God moved through, like He did through Job and the prophets, He’s moved through you through that channel as a Christian, by His Divine revelation that “you are healed,” then there’s nothing going to keep it from happening. So we give Him glory, all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each … (Every doubt; washed away every doubt.) I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinner slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain. Oh, don’t you love Him? Ah, how wonderful. “I have heard of Thee, Lord, with my ear, and faith cometh by hearing; but now I see Thee, God making Himself known among His people like He did to Abraham, by His promise here that the Son of man would reveal Himself in the days that the world become in a Sodom condition.” And there was three messengers went forth, come down from Heaven. And there was a denominational group down in Sodom, and a Billy Graham and a Oral Roberts went down there. And remember as I’ve told you, no where in the history of the church has there ever been a messenger sent universal to the church, until now, with his name ending like Abraham, h-a-m. G-r-a-h-a-m, six letters, to the world, man’s number. But Abraham had seven letters in the name, God’s complete and perfect number. See? And notice what the messengers did that went out in there: preached the Word, called them out, told them to repent. But the One who stayed back with Abraham, see, performed a miracle by telling Abraham what Sarah was doing and thinking in the tent behind Him. And Jesus, who was the One that was in this person, said, “When the world gets in a Sodom condition, like it was then, the Son of man will be revealed again.” And all the other Scriptures confirming that to be so. The … “In the beginning was the” [Congregation says, “Word,”] “and the Word was with” [“God,”] “and the Word was” [“God.”] “And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Is that right? Now we see that same promised Word, of Luke, of Malachi, all these other promises from today, made flesh, dwelling among us, that we heard with our ears; now we see Him (with our eyes) interpreting His Own Word, we don’t need any interpretation of man. O church of the living God, here and on the phones, wake up quick, before it’s too late! God bless you. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me, And purchased my salvation On Calvary tree. Could you think, church, that you’re looking with your own eyes … The living Word of God made manifest, the promise of the hour, in the last days, looking with your own eyes at the living Word being interpreted in natural form, God among us! “I see Him with my own eyes, the One … I heard that He would do it.” All the old sages looked for this day, now we see It manifested with our own eye. How many the old shouting Methodists, Baptists, and the real, genuine pentecostals in their age, longed to see this happen! Many of them knowed it would happen. But we stand tonight seeing it happen! Oh! Don’t you love Him? Now, Jesus said, “This will all men know you’re My disciples, when you love one another.” So as we love Him, let’s shake one anothers’ hands and sing I Will Praise Him! I Will Praise Him! All right. I will praise Him! I will praise Him! O praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all … (How you do?) … people For His Blood has washed away each stain. What did the queen of Belteshazzar say before her king that night? “There is a man in your kingdom that is a dissolver of doubts.” And the Holy Ghost, tonight, is the dissolver of doubts! Do you believe that? [Brother Branham speaks to someone.] The dissolver of doubts! Now, the Blood of Christ takes away each stain, the stain of doubt. There’s not a greater sin in the world than unbelief, “For he that believeth not, is condemned already!” Is that right? “He that believeth not is condemned.” There’s only one sin, and that’s unbelief. Smoking’s not a sin, cursing’s not a sin, committing adultery’s not a sin, lying is not a sin; that isn’t sin, that’s the results of unbelief. Unbelief! You do it because you don’t believe. If you do believe It, you don’t do it. Oh! Oh! What … Wonderful! And the Blood of the Lamb has washed away every doubt. We believe His Word, emphatically. We believe that the Word was made flesh. And we believe the Word is made flesh by the vindication of His Presence now to confirm His Word. Do you believe It? God bless you. We hope to see you here in the morning, for a great time in the Lord. Bow your heads now, and I give the service to Brother Lindsay. 
Morning! Happy to be here this morning. And we’re glad, enjoying this great fellowship around these old songs of faith. We love that. Don’t you? The Amen chorus. That’s what He is, the Amen, see. He’s got the last word to say. I was setting over there talking to my old friend, Brother Brown, while the songs was going on. And he said, “Brother Branham, I never seen till yesterday, what you’ve been talking about.” He said, “If people could just get into what you’re speaking about,” said, “every obstacle would move out of the way.” That’s exactly right. That’s right. It’s exactly right. If you could just grasp It and catch It. See? Talking to my little friend, Ernie Fandler. I guess some of you out on the hookups will remember Ernie, how he was converted, how he was led to the Lord. He doesn’t talk good English, or I’d like to have him come say a word. And he gets his we’s and W’s all mixed up. He was asking me if I remember the time at the Shawano where he lives. There was a man died right in the meeting, dropped over in his seat dead, Lutheran. We had everybody keep quiet. Spoke the Word of the Lord over him, he come back to life, come right up over him. They’ve never got over that, wants us come back again. I understood that in France, this morning, there’s better than two thousand Frenchmen on a several-day fast that we’ll come bring the Message to France in French. The whole Protestant nation, Protestant part of the nation of France. And so we are … It’s just begin blooming now, just begin, the shuck’s pulling away so the wheat can lay out there now. See? So just keep reverent, keep praying. See? Remember, “They that wait upon the Lord, renew their strength.” Now, there’s … I was … getting pretty old, and I thought, “Will I … Will there be another revival, I’ll see another time?” And just remember, from the west will come a white horse rider. We’ll ride this trail again. That’s right. Soon as we get ready. It’s a promise, you see. Now, I want to say to Brother Leo … I was talking about Brother Wood last night, his brother being here. Brother Leo, if you and the little group that’s hooked in up there this morning; Sister Mercier, your father’s here. I seen him last night. He’s around here in the building somewhere, and he looks fine and dandy. The morning he was healed up at the tabernacle, there was two major cancer cases, real dying, and both of them was healed. And their father, an elderly man in a heart attack, was brought out to the glory of God. And he’s in the meeting here somewhere. I can’t see him amongst the crowd now, but he was here last night. Greetings to all of you out across the land; here in this wonderful place, of the Life Tabernacle here at Shreveport, with a whole jammed-out crowd for a Sunday school. You know, if I lived at Shreveport, not saying nothing against anybody, but this would be the place I’d come to church at, right here at the Life Tabernacle. This is not a denomination. The Life Tabernacle, is today, is a interdenominational tabernacle. They come out of the denomination because they accepted me and this Message I preach. Brother Jack Moore, my brother and friend, he was taken from the denominations because he associated with me. And so I think he deserves some credit. That’s right. God bless him. And hold up his hands in prayer, and believe with him. And now Sister Moore, I don’t see her anywhere, she … Yes, back here. She looked like a little girl setting over there this morning, all this dressed up, new, and just looked like a Easter outfit. And it_it looked like … Brother Jack didn’t even know her hisself. Now, Sister Moore. We sure miss Anna Jeanne and Don, and all of them. Glad to meet Brother Nolan, he was one of the associates here. And Brother Ernie, I asked him yesterday if he’d sing that Amen. I’ve got it on a record, and I’ve wore the thing out just listening over it, Amen. I think he’s got a voice for that; beats any of them. And little Judy, I noticed her; the two, they look just like brother and sister. Don’t they? They’re husband and wife. Look at the each of them, see why they just look exactly. See? And really a lovely little couple. That’s, you know, that’s … Brother Palmer that’s just climbed the golden stairs, that’s his daughter and son-in-law. And that’s … She is certainly a contribution to his well training of a child. And he’s got others too, married ministers also, and these are the evangelists and on their field, and others. So it’s just great. I haven’t seen Sister Palmer. Really, I don’t know whether I’d know her if I seen her, or not. She’s, perhaps, somewhere (of course) in the meeting. Back in the back; God bless you, Sister Palmer. My heart shakes every time I think of it. Brother Palmer had just climbed the steps till, a few minutes, until I got the message that he was gone. I just couldn’t believe it. Billy called me, and somebody had got a hold … and they knowed. We were such lovely friends, and to know that he was gone, it was really shaking. But we all got to go, regardless of who we are, we must go one by one. But there’s only one thing, “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the full duty of man,” Ecclesiastes 12. Now, I haven’t got too much time for this Sunday school lesson, and I’m hoarse. Say, Brother Pearry Green done a noble thing. He heard me say, last night, “I missed my little piece of hair to keep me … ” He called out there and tried to get somebody fly it in for me. I said, “You’re too late, I’m already hoarse.” I tried for years to find some accomplishment, but when I got that, it cured it. But I forgot it this time, so I’m a little bit hoarse. So you bear with me, if you will, in speaking. Now, how many likes Sunday school? Oh, my, that’s right. It’s a good thing to send your children to. No, let me correct that, a good thing to bring your children to. That’s right, to bring your children; you come also. How many knows how our Sunday school was first originated? Where was it originated? England. What was it called first? Ragged school. That’s right, called “Ragged school.” As I forget the man’s name now that established it. What was, his name? [Someone says, “Robert Raikes.” _ Ed.] That’s right, exactly right. And he got the little fellows off the street (was ragged, and wouldn’t have no place to go, and very bad), and he brought them in and started giving them lessons on the Bible. And it’s growed to one of the greatest orders of the church, nearly, today, Sunday school. Good to go. Be sure to come, bring your children. I think the tabernacle here has teachers, equipped rooms, ages, and so forth. And you new converts that’s just coming to Christ, follow right on along the Message; come here at the Life Tabernacle, and they’ll do you good. Now, tonight we’re going to have an old-fashioned prayer line. We’re going to just pray for the sick the way we used to, Brother Jack and Brother Brown. I remember seeing Brother Brown try to give out those prayer cards, and how him being a minister himself … And in those days, in a organization that we … they put pressure on him, you know, “I_I’m your brother,” in this thing, you know. “You got to get me up there.” Oh, he sure had a hard time, but stayed just as true as true could be. Brother Brown is one fine man. And so we love him. And as I see all of us, the three of us getting … creeping up towards the aged, the end. It’ll be a very sad thing if we didn’t have placed within us that great thing, what we know is Truth. We’re just fixing to turn back one of these days, back to our young manhood again, to never … our bodies transformed, made into His likeness to stand. “For when this earthly tabernacle of our habitation be dissolved, there’s one already waiting.” And the thankful part of it, dear friend, that the dear Lord Jesus … You who trust me to tell you the Truth; the dear Lord Jesus, one morning about eight o’clock, let me see that Land. Now, it wasn’t_it wasn’t a vision; but I don’t want to say that. Ever what it was, it was just as real as I’m speaking to you here. Now, I seen the faces of those people, and I couldn’t recognize them, they had turned back young again. And they was just real as … I’d hold their hands and things. Just as real … And it helped me, because I used to have an idea: when a person died, just their soul went off. But then when He quoted that to me, that “If this earthly tabernacle of our habitation be … we already have one.” See? And we got to have everything in threes, to make a perfection. See? And there’s one body here, then that body there which is the_the celestial body, and then the glorified body in the resurrection. See, that makes it complete. See? So it’s a … It’s not a myth, it’s not an idea, it’s not a spirit. It is a man and a woman like you are, just exactly. And then, years ago, I seen the regions of the lost, and was there. I tell you, friend, as an old man, let me persuade you this, across the nation this morning, don’t never want to view that place. There’s no way at all that I could … if I was an artist with a brush I couldn’t paint the picture. As a minister, I couldn’t describe to you. Talk about hell being a burning place, it’s a million times worse than that, the horrors that goes with it. And Heaven … or this place, wherever it was, I don’t know what to call it. He referred to it there as “souls under the altar.” But when it was, I have never … There’s no way to explain how great that is. There is … Now, you just have to take my word, I’m just a man. See? But these visions that’s always come to pass just as I have told you, and you know they every one has been true, that is true also. Whatever you do, if you miss everything else (health, strength, your eyesight, whatever it is), don’t miss That. There’s nothing can compare with it. It’s … There’s no_there’s no word in the English language, that I know, that could express it. If you’d say “perfect,” it’s beyond that; “superb,” it_it’s beyond that; “sublime,” …  There’s no_there’s no words that I know that could express it, because it was so … And then, to think, that isn’t the end of it yet. I thought, “Me be afraid to come to this?” I said, “Do you eat?” Said, “Not here. We don’t eat here, but when we go back to earth we’ll receive a body we eat in.” Well, I could feel them. They was just like that. See? And they … I said, “Well, you have … ” Oh, yes, they have a body. Just not a myth, it’s a body. We know one another. They all knowed me, were hugging me, millions of them. And I said, “Well, I want to see Him Who brought me here.” It said, “You can’t see Him now, you have to wait.” I said, “Why did you put me on … up here?” Said, “You were a leader in life.” And I said, “Do You mean all them’s Branhams?” He said, “No! That’s your converts to Christ.” See? I looked around, and then all the hard nights, and the trials, passed away, when I could see their faces. A young woman run up there, one of the most beautiful women, and she just threw her arms around me, and said, “Precious Brother.” And when she passed by … Now, she was a woman. So … But in there, there’ll never be sin. See, our glands are changed there. They won’t raise children no more, there. See? See, all the same. What makes the difference, the sensation. That’s the reason I don’t believe in dancing on the floor. No man … I, before God and my Bible, I’ve lived clean, as that way through my life when I was a little boy, all through my young manhood. Any girl I ever went out with, I can walk right back to the Judgment with her. See? But there’s no man, I don’t care who you are, can let a woman (in the make of a woman) hug herself up close to you; if you’re a true healthy man, there’s a sensation. But it wasn’t there; there’s no glands. You’re all the same gland. See? Just pure, unadulterated sisterly and brotherly love, more than it would be for your … even for your … hug your own little daughter. See? Your own daughter, yet she’s made … she’s female and you’re a male. See, it could create something; but There it can’t, sin is done, it’s all over. See? Real … just real, holy Love. And I looked at that woman. There was … looked like millions of them there, and they all long hair, and white garments down. And_and this One that was talking to me, said, “Don’t you recognize her?” I said, “No.” Said, “She was in her ninety’s when you led her to Christ.” “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.” See? Just no way of ever explaining what it is. Just take my word if you believe me. Be sure to make … burn every bridge of the world behind you. I believe the church is beginning to hear the Message, and begin to understand. But, friends, listen, we’ve got to lay in the Presence of the Son, we’ve got to be ripened. Our_our faith isn’t ripe. Intellectually we’re hearing the Message that God has give us, and seeing the signs that He showed us, and proving it by the Bible, it’s there, but, oh, how the church needs to lay in His Presence till it tenders up, you know, and gets sweet in the Spirit so that it can bathe down. Sometime in speaking the Message, you get harsh, have to break it in like that, because you’ve got to clinch a nail to make it hold. But when the Church once gets It, the Elected is called out and separated, then in the Presence of God, I know it’ll be something like the people was there when it takes its Rapture. I was going to speak this morning on The Rapture, but I just don’t have enough voice to do it, and so you just bear with me a little while. What I want to speak on, the subject of: God’s Only Provided Place Of Worship. Now, it’s a great big text. So let us pray now. And out across the lands this morning, wherever you are, bow your heads just a few moments. Be real sincere now, we’re approaching the Word of God, which is God in a letter form. Great Author of this Book, “It is a Seed,” we are taught, “that a sower sowed,” so said the Author. Now, we do realize that a seed will grow if it’s in the right kind of ground. So, Father, will You this morning take all the briars and thistles, and unbelief, and skeptic thoughts out of our heart; that the Word of God might grow freely, watered by the Spirit in our hearts, that we might become the people of God. Grant it, Father. That’s our hearts. Not only to we who have recognized this, but may there be others throughout the country, each one’s heart burning with love and tenderness, will go to try to win the lost brother, the lost sister. Grant it today, God. We’re looking wholly to You, for You are our guide and our Lord. So we pray that You’ll direct us in Your Word today, and give us of Thy blessings. Through Thy grace and in Thy Name we ask it. Amen. Now, let’s take for our text … I want to read from the Book of Deuteronomy, the Old Testament, just for a setting of Scripture. I have a few notes I wrote out quickly after I’d come back from breakfast with Brother Vayle. I never did get to thank the man over at that hotel … that restaurant the other night, that paid for our_for our supper. Wife and I and my little girl was over there, and when I went to pay my bill, somebody had paid it. Ever who it was, I thank you. Said, “The man that set on the end of the bench.” Course there was a whole group in there that we knowed. Now, I … some kind of a Kickapoo, something like that, the place out here, restaurant we were at. Thank you, ever who it was that did that. Each one of you, God bless you. Now, in 16th chapter of Deuteronomy, it’s the passover observance. So we wish to read about the first few verses, first four or five, six verses here. Observe the month of Abid, and keep the passover … (That means “April.”) … the Lord thy God: for in the month of this Abid the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. Thou shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord thy God, of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name … Thou shall eat the unleavened bread within it; seven days shall thou eat unleavened, bread_bread wherewith, … thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: … thou mayest remember the_the day when thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. And there shall not be … unleavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there be any thing of the flesh, which thou has sacrificed the first day at the evening, remain all night until the morning. Thou may not sacrifice the passover within any of the gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee: But at the place which the Lord thy God has chosen to place his name in, there thou shall sacrifice the passover at evening, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou comest forth out of Egypt. Now may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word. Now, is the microphones got a blur in it? Last night I heard they were. Can you hear all right, all over? You can’t hear. [Brother Branham adjusts the microphone _ Ed.] Is that better? Is this better, speaking with the microphones down like this? I’m just a little hoarse, so I’m standing close this morning for that purpose, and I hope that Brother Pearry can_can get it out there. Can you hear it all right now? I think they’ve fixed it up. All right. Now, the pla- … The thing I want to speak about this morning is that God has only one place that the worshipper can meet God, only one place. Through the ages many has sought for this secret place of God, through all the ages. Even Job wanted to know where He lived at, “If I could only go to His house and knock at His door.” Job wanted to find God’s dwelling place, ’cause there God and His family is worshipped together. Like yesterday, in the message yesterday morning, we find out that there is a possibility of a person to worship God in vain, with sincere worship. God has all these things fixed out for us, but the thing of it is, we have to search to find where they are. Paul told Timothy to search, and to_to be in season and out of season, ready to give a_a_a word or … of the hope that was within him. Now, all these things are in there. And we find … Sometime I’d like to come to Shreveport where we just have about two or three weeks just to take thirty minutes a night and just on a teaching, see, just stay right in the Word, these secret passages, see, where we could find out just how to get in. And you just watch, you follow God’s direction, there’s only one key to each door. That’s right. And no other key, no matter how much it looks like it, God has no skeleton key; just got one key. And now, you’ve got to have that key, or the door won’t unlock. No matter how sincere you are, you still can’t unlock that door. Now, how many was at yesterday’s breakfast, the other morning? All right, I think most, at least ninety percent of you, or more. To background this, what I’m going to say, David was anointed king (anointed of God), the greatest king Israel ever had, outside of the Lord Jesus (which is God) the Anointed One. David is his son … or Jesus was David’s son according to the lineage, the flesh. And He’s to set on David’s throne as one … inherit, like the_the prince always inherits the_the king’s throne. Notice, now, that David being anointed, yet with the anointing he did, he got out of the will of the Lord with that anointing; and all the people, not taking the run of the Scripture or the key to this revelation, all of them anointed too, they all, together, shouting and praising God for a thing that looked exactly right: to bring the Word of God back to the house of God. But David was king, not prophet. See? He … There was a prophet in the land to do it by, and God dishonored the whole move because they never used the right key. The door didn’t unlock. And now we must remember that, and keep that in mind. There is … Everything of God, one certain way it’s to be done, and that settles it. Now, there, God had a one certain Church that He meets the people in, and He will receive you in that Church and no other church. I’ve said this because I’ve been so many times misunderstood, and people has told me … I say, “Are you a Christian?” “I’m Baptist.” “Are you a Christian?” “I’m a Methodist.” “Are you a Christian?” “I’m a Pentecostal.” Now, see, that doesn’t mean one thing to God. You’re just progging with the wrong key. But there is a right key, there is one where God … God never promised to meet you at the Methodist, or at the Baptist, or at Pentecostals, or no other denomination. He don’t even consider the denominations, they’re against Him. On that long Message, I’ll get It at the tabernacle pretty soon. And then Brother Jack will hear It, and then you can see what you want to do about It, ’cause It’ll be taped. Now, people act like that God is obligated just to meet them on the basis of their theology. Now, people act like that. They won’t associate even with one another. The Trinity or the Pentecost won’t associate with the Oneness, neither will the Oneness associate with the Trinity. The Methodist won’t with the Baptist, because one is a legalist and the other’s a Calvinist, so they have no fellowship at all. And they wind the people’s minds around so bad that they even against one another. I went to pray, sometime ago, in a hospital room. There was a lady laying there very sick, going under an operation, they expected her to die. Another lady laying there (I was called to pray for her.), I said to her, “Would you mind just a moment if I pray?” And she said, “Pull that curtain!” And I said, “I’m sorry.” I said, “I was just going to ask prayer.” She said, “Pull that curtain!” I said, “Yes, ma’am.” Her and her son setting there, a regular little Ricky look. And I said, “Well, aren’t you a Christian?” She said, “We are Methodist!” Said, “Well, I never asked you that, I asked you if you was a ‘Christian.’” See? And so she said, “Pull that curtain!” See, because somebody that wasn’t a Methodist was going to offer prayer for a dying woman, which she was too. But because it wasn’t associated in her own organization, she didn’t even want to hear it or have nothing to do with it. If that ain’t a Pharisee, I never seen one! Wait till you hear The Trail Of The Serpent. Huh. All right. Now, think now that their denomination is the only one that registers with God: “God won’t hear you unless you’re a Methodist, or a Baptist, or a_a Trinity, or a Oneness,” or something like that. That’s wrong! And that’s my purpose; but if there is such a_a desire in people’s minds and hearts to be right … I don’t believe the woman done it because … or anybody else. A Methodist wouldn’t raise up and take up for the Methodist church because he_he knew it was wrong. The man thinks it’s right. I don’t believe a Trinity would condemn a Oneness, or a Oneness a Trinity and Pentecost, because he wants to be different, he thinks he’s right. And you must respect his idea. You know, the blanket stretches both way. But, remember, in all that, if there’s something in a man’s heart or a woman’s heart that they believed that that is “right,” then there’s got to be somewhere that is right. As I’ve often said, “When the deep calls to the deep, there’s got to be a deep to respond to that call.” You know, we’ve been told that_that a seal once walked upon the bank of the_of the sea, with legs. But now he doesn’t have legs, they turned into flaps because he could … had need of the flaps when he took it from the land, a fur-bearing animal, to the sea; nature formed him some flaps instead of legs, ’cause he could swim more than he did of his walking. I can’t think of this great man now that went to the south pole. What was his name? Byrd. They say that he had coats made for some cattle, on this exposition; that he’d taken the cattle for milk. And he made fur coats to keep them cattle from freezing to death. But when he got there, they didn’t need any fur coat, nature had growed them one. See? Why? Before there was a fin on a fish’s back, there had to be a water for him to swim in or he’d never had a fin. There … Before there was a tree to grow in the earth, there had to be an earth first for it to grow in, or there’d been no tree. So, you see, as long as there’s something in the human heart calling for something, there’s got to be something out there to respond, to satisfy that call. A woman … An autopsy was held here sometime ago on a woman that died. And the reason, they_they claim, that killed her, she eat onions just constantly, all the time. If she wasn’t eating onions, her head would be itching, and everything; they couldn’t make it out. So holding the autopsy, they found a growth in the woman of some kind of cells; they had a_a name for it. And they could take that growth and put it in a bowl of onions, and it dissolved the onions overnight. See? What was it? It was something in the woman calling for onion, and if there had been no onions there’d been no growth. In other words, there has to be a Creator first, before there could be a creation. See? Now, if in the human heart there is a longing, like Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, all these others, trying to find that one true way, and they’re told by their priests and pastors, and so forth, that “This is the true way.” They say, the priest says, “There’s no salvation outside the Catholic church.” Well, each church takes his … their own idea. Some of them won’t admit it, but they do it by their action. Your action speaks louder than your word. It’s just a … In otherwise, they’re just more of a hypocrite than the Catholic is. The Catholic confesses it right out, “I believe that this is the only thing,” but they won’t do that. They hide it, but their actions prove what they’re thinking. See? Now, there’s got to be then one place, because there is a desire in the human heart to find It. And I think that the Word of God has the answer for everything that we have need of. So God has the answer, and let’s search for it now in the Scriptures. And then if God will show us by the Scriptures the only place, the only ground, (the only denomination, if it’s so), the only way that God will meet a man, then we should hold to that ’cause we found the Truth of the Bible, what It says. Now, the word Deuteronomy, the word itself means “two laws,” the word Deuteronomy. And God has two laws. The two laws: one of them is disobedience to the Word, and die; and the other one is obedience to the Word, and live. That’s the two laws, and Deuteronomy means those two laws. They have both been absolutely displayed to us in the Scripture. One of them is death, the other one is Life; Life and death. God deals only in Life, Satan only in death. And these was displayed to the world publicly, openly before every eye, and there’s no excuse for us. One of them was, displayed on Mount Sinai when the law was given, which condemned the whole human race to death; the other one was give on Mount Calvary, that brought the whole human race to Life, when the penalty was paid in Jesus Christ. The two laws of Deuteronomy was fulfilled in these two, great things. I want you to notice again, there was also two covenants give. One covenant was given to Adam, which was on conditions, like law: “If you will not touch this, then you will live; but if you touch this, you will die.” That was a law. Then there was another law given to Abraham, which was by grace, unconditionally: “I have saved you and your seed after you.” Amen! That is a type of Calvary, not the type of_of_of Adam covenant, it’s a Abrahamic covenant. But now we hear Him say there is only one place where He will meet man to worship. We read it right here in the text. We’ll refer to it, back, in a few minutes. Then if there’s only one place that God meets man, we had better be very careful. Now let’s lay aside our traditions this morning, and … in this Sunday-school lesson, and be very sure that we find that one place. Because, God has said here, He will not receive you in any other place. Any other church, He won’t receive you in. Only in His Church, the only place He’ll receive you. Now, “What’d you say, Brother Branham? If I’m sincere?” No. Remember, Jesus talked to some sincere people, the worshippers of His day, and He said, “In vain do you worship Me.” True, genuine worship from the bottom of their hearts. “In vain do you worship Me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of man,” or their denominational creed. Sincere, reverently, just as religious as they can be. And that wasn’t new just with the Pharisees. Cain and Abel, the first two worshippers that was borned, natural birth here, on earth, absolutely came in the same attitude. Cain was just as religious as Abel was. They both built altars. They both loved God. They both made sacrifices. They both worshipped. They both paid tithe. They both done everything just alike. But Abel, by faith which is “the revelation,” the Word of God revealed, made plain, showed out, and vindicated. Glory! Cain made an offering, but God didn’t vindicate it. God required worship, and Cain made the offering, but God didn’t vindicate it. But by the true channel … You say, “Well, my church is It. My … ” Wait just a minute. God interprets His Own Word by Its terms that He spoke in. See, Cain said, “I am religious. I am a lover of my Maker. I offer to Thee this fine altar. I offer to You this sacrifice. I built all these things up, Lord, because I love you.” Abel said the same thing. Now it’s the one that’s vindicated, the one that’s proven. And God come down and received Abel’s sacrifice, because by revelation he had struck the true channel of God that was accepted. Now watch that Cain spirit come right down through the Scripture, right on to this very last day. Fundamental? Just as fundamental as the other one was. Look at the prophet Balaam and the prophet Moses. Both of them with seven altars, Jehovah’s altars, blood on each one; and not only that, but rams on each one. In numerology, exactly the right number, seven, “perfect,” seven rams. Just exactly alike, both altars. As fundamental as one was, the other one was also. But who did God vindicate? See? See? The one that was in His Word. Fundamental doesn’t mean too much; it’s the revelation of God. Now think! These man, why was they called and was put in this condition (these Pharisees) by Jesus, said, “In vain you worship Me”? Worship Him: genuine worship, true worship from their hearts. “You … In vain you worship Me.” Why? “Teaching for doctrine your tradition of man, therefore you make the commandments of God of no effect to the people.” If I taught you a Methodist message, it would take no effect on you, this is Bride time. If Moses taught the message of Noah, it would take no effect. If Jesus taught Moses’ message, it would take no effect. Because the predestinated seed are laying there that will only be watered by that type of water that’s give for that seed. See? It won’t grow any other condition. It must be the condition that grows it. Now, you can take a chicken egg and put it in a incubator, which should be under a hen, but it’ll hatch anyhow. Put it under a pup it would hatch. It’s the warmness, the condition that makes it hatch. So it has to be under condition. You could take a good live egg and put it under a dead hen, it won’t hatch. See? See, it’s the condition. Well, that’s the way it is in this age that we’re living in, you’ve got to find what is God’s way of doing it for this age. That’s what Martin Luther found, that’s what John Wesley found, that’s what the Pentecostals found in their age. God’s age and time to do it. Now, the Pentecostals. That brother, one … I believe his … one of his eyes was out, a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California, the old Azusa Street. He was laughed at, because he was a negro. He was made fun of, but he brought a message for that age. Just a little body, a fellow could hardly sign his own name, but the Lord had revealed to him that this was the age for the restoration of those gifts, and they come. No matter what said, it come. But everybody got in the atmosphere of it, and seen it was that age, and seen God vindicating that those people could speak with tongues, and so forth, it happened. But then when he went and pinned it down that “this is the only evidence,” that killed it. See? Goes right on, see. That did it. Then they started separating this, that, and making denominations; and one’s coming on a cloud, and the other one’s come in a bush. And oh, my, there it goes. That’s what denominations does. See? God is not a author of denomination, because denomination is Babylon, and He’s not the author of confusion. We see her all … You don’t have to be even intellectual to see that. It’s Babylon! See? Tradition (think of it), sincere people. Now, still, because they believe that, there still needs to be one sincere place where God meets. Now notice verse 2. “Worship in the place that I have chosen.” The sacrifice, of course, where they worshipped over the sacrifice. “The place that I chose; not what you chose, what man chose. But what I have chosen, you worship in this place.” There shows there’s then only one place, others is vain. It must be not of your choice, but it must be His choice. “Well, I don’t have to go to the church.” Or, “You are so narrow-minded! Why, you’ll even fuss at women about preaching, and … or women about bobbing their hair, and men about these other things. Why, you’re so narrow-minded!” All right, you don’t have to take God’s Word about it, you go on out where, they do that at. See? And you’ll find out it’s in the Scripture, so, “In vain do they worship Me.” Jesus spoke of the same thing. See? That every little jot, everything, you must be faithful in. It’s always the little_the little vine, the little_the little fox that spoils the vine. Sometimes you leave … It’s not the big things you do, it’s the little things you leave undone. Remember, a chain is only its strongest at its weakest link. “Blessed are they that do all the commandments of God, that they might have a right to enter in.” Do all God said, and It said for women to have long hair. You say … A man told me not long ago, said, “I don’t preach a clothes-line religion.” I said, “Then you’re not preaching the Gospel.” Yeah. God laid it out there, He said what to do. And you either do it … That’s your natural, reasonable thing. What little thing …  what … the little insignificant. Jesus said, “Blessed are they that would take all the little thing, do the little things.” And a woman to let her hair grow, that’s just a … why, it’s just something she can do, and she won’t even do that. She won’t even do that. “Oh, teach us the great things.” How can you teach the great things, when you won’t do the simple, common thing? Because, you see, your motive and your objective is wrong. It’s your love to God, “Lord, I don’t care what You want me to do, I’m willing to do it.” Then you’re getting somewhere, but if you don’t do it that way, the way He said do it … It’s His choosing, “The place that I have chosen.” That’s where you worship with your sacrifice. You put … Cain brought his sacrifice, Abel brought his, it depends on what place you take it into. If you take it into the place where He’s chosen, it’ll be all right, He’ll accept it; if it’s not, He won’t accept it. Don’t care … it’s the same sacrifice, whatever it is, it’s still un- … rejected, unless it’s brought to that one certain place. Now we want to find out where we want to bring this sacrifice. We could find out … We all want to go to Heaven. Don’t we? And we all know we’ve done wrong. We all believe that Jesus is the Sacrifice. Now we want to know where to take Him, it’ll be_it’ll be accepted. See? That’s right. The Bible tells us where to take it, see, and it’ll be accepted; outside of there, it won’t be accepted. Let us notice here also the place that He chose for the sacrifice to be laid, the place that He chose to put the sacrifice. You can’t put it on any of these gates; but the place that He chose to put it, He also put His Name in that place. That’s what He said here. He chose to put His Name in it. Now let us search the Scriptures for this place, for that is the place where He put His Name. Now let’s read from the text. And I had a little note laying here that I … this morning, come to me. Let’s take the 2nd verse of this chapter. Now, I don’t want to hold too long, on account of the people, on these hookups out here. Now the 2nd verse of this 16th chapter: Thou shall therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord thy God, of thy flocks and thy herd, in the place which the Lord shall choose to put his name there. Now, you can’t take this … your sincerity and all that you want to confess, you just can’t take it to the Methodist altar, to a Baptist altar, to a Pentecostal altar, but there is a altar somewhere that He chose that He … to put His Name in it, and He would meet you at that place. Now, if you get everything running just right, it’s going to run; everything’s set in order. If there’s a short in that wire, that light won’t come on; because it’s been grounded. And when you’ll take one of God’s Words or one of His places, and in your own heart have selfish objectives, it’ll ground the power of God right there. If you do it because you want to be smart, you want to be different from somebody else, or something, right there it’s grounded, it’ll blow the fuse. You’re wrong. You’ve got to come with sincerity, with all your heart. Your motives and your objectives, place right on God. Then search for His place, find where He said, and bring it there. See? Look at Martha and Mary. When Jesus had come back, after He had taught them this Gospel (the Light of His day, Him being Messiah), He was hated, rejected. Oh, the Pharisees and churches despised Him. But Lazarus had died, the brother which was a bosom friend to Him. He let him lay there; and they sent for Him, He didn’t even come. But watch Martha, her attitude. She said, “Lord, if Thou would have been here.” Give Him His right title: Lord, capital L-o-r-d, Yahweh, Jehovah. Glory! “If Thou would have been here, my brother would not have died.” Life and death can’t associate in the same channel, or same house. “Thou would … He would have not have died.” Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and Life,” saith God. See? When He said, first, “Thy brother shall live again.” She said, “Yes, Lord, I truly believe that. As a Jewess, I believe that there will be a general resurrection of the dead; and I believe my brother was just as loyal and sincere in worship. And I believe that You are that Messiah, that said in the Bible, because God vindicating His Word in You shows that You’re the messenger of this hour. You are that Messiah. I believe that You are that Christ that was to come, because Your works testify that God has sent You here to be that Messiah.” Oh, my! Watch the cogs begin to come in place now. See? Now, she had a right to say, “Why didn’t You come raise my brother? Why didn’t You heal him? You healed others. Your very best friend, and now look what happened.” No, no, that kind of objective don’t get no where. “I believe that You’re exactly what You’re identified in the Scripture to be. I believe this is the day that the Messiah should come; we’ve been looking for it. I don’t care what the rest of them say. I believe with all my heart, by what I have seen and heard by the Word, that the Word is vindicated in You, that You are that Messiah.” See, way down in her, she_she had something to ask for, but she had to come to the right channel. What if she’d run up there and said, “And then You tell me You’re that Messiah! And not even the courtesy, gentlemen enough to even answer our request; when we fed You and housed You, and everything, and took up for You, and left our churches, as You commanded us to get out of them denominations.” See? “And here we’ve left it, and now we’re counted offcasts and renegades. And everything that we’ve done for You, and then not even the common courtesy to answer my call?” Now, actually, she had that right. Like you say about your short hair, “I’m an American citizen. I can wear shorts, do anything I want to, not illegal.” That’s your rights, but a sheep always forfeits its rights. Uh-huh. If you’re a lamb, you ain’t got nothing but wool, he forfeits that. That’s his God-given rights, but he forfeits it. “I have a right to join any denomination.” That’s exactly right, but you forfeit that. See? She forfeit all that she had rights to, to recognize the Word of God manifested right there before her. He said, “I am the resurrection and Life. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?” See, there was one more little clause she hadn’t come in line with. See? “Yea, Lord! I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God!” O brother, everything was ready to spark off right then. See? “Where have you laid him?” See? And you know what took place. See, you’ve got to get in that right place before He will receive your sacrifice. See, got to come into it. Watch.  … in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there. Thou shall eat no leavened bread in it; … What does that typify in the sacrifice? Don’t mix it with any creed, got to be the Word. “No leavened bread.” Leaven is the …  You know what a leaven is in anything. “A little leaven leavens the whole lump,” the whole lump is the Body. You can’t put one speck of denomination or creed into Christ. No, sir, it won’t work. You remember the last Thursday night’s message? Your old husband must be dead. Right. Your new Husband is the Word.  … seven days shall thou eat unleavened bread therein, … “Seven days,” what does that typify? The complete Seven Church Ages, seven days. Why’d they have to eat it seven days? Before what? Before going out. And the whole church age, from the beginning to the end, has to live only on the Word of God of that age. So your Roman creed, Methodist, Baptist, and Pentecostal creed’s all dead. Now watch.  … therein, even the bread of affliction; … Persecuted for It; Luther, Wesley, Pentecostals; all persecuted, and so will you.  … for thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: … thou mayest remain the day when … remember the day when thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. And there shall be no leavened bread seen in … with thee in all thy coast seven days; … In the beautiful Bride of Christ, after Her death through the Dark Ages by the Roman empire, that She had to die, “Unless a corn of wheat falls into the ground.” The Bridegroom had to come, the perfect Masterpiece of God. You all heard my message on that. And I stood down there, Los Angeles, at Forest Lawn, one day, and my heart jumped. How many’s ever been in Forest Lawn? There is a … the statue of Moses by_by … -angelo, I believe it is Michelangelo. And it’s a perfect statue, all but on the right knee; there is a nick about a half inch deep. And the guide … I was looking, and he pointed it out to me. He said, “Michelangelo had spent a lifetime of trying to_to make … He was a sculptor, and he was trying to make the image of Moses. Back in his mind, he had in mind what Moses should look like. He had that in his heart, what Moses should look like. And then he spent his lifetime; chisel a little here, and rub it, stand back and look at it. Year after year after year, he worked on it. Finally when it was completed, and he stepped back and laid down his rag and his hammer, he looked at the statue. It was so perfect the image of Moses that he had in his heart, till he got so beside himself, he grabbed the hammer and struck it, hollered, ‘Speak!’” It’s called Michelangelo’s Masterpiece. That great something in that sculptor, that vision that he had of what Moses ought to be with, was only portraying in type of the great Father God. He had in His heart, before the foundation of the world, a Son, because He is a Father. But it was still in the genes of His Word. And He created a man, and He had to put him on free moral agency, but that man fell. But the great Sculptor, God, who made man from the dust of the earth, He didn’t settle for that, He started making man again. And He made a Noah, he died drunk. He made a Moses that failed to keep His Word. He made prophets that run in the time of trouble. And He kept building and molding until after while He wanted a_a masterpiece, to reflect Him, His nature, what was in His heart what a son should be. One day, down on Jordan, after that Masterpiece had been formed and made, there He come sending down in a … on the wings of a Dove, said, “This is Him!” He was so enthused with this Masterpiece until He struck Him on Calvary, that He would die, for the rest of us was imperfect; that through the shedding of His Blood, He might bring many masterpieces (being a Bride) to His Son. Masterpiece is scarred because the enthusiasm of God to see such a Masterpiece, He struck Him for us all. See? There He died, to perfect we who are imperfect. The Masterpiece. Notice in here. He said:  … seven days shall you eat this unleavened bread … Now, bread is typed. Jesus said, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.” Not just_just a Word here and there as denominations would have you believe It. But the Word of God is perfect! It’s God Himself in letter form, called a “Seed.” And the right kind of unadulterated faith in that Word will bring that Seed to its Life. That’s exactly what you see at night in the discernments, and all these other things, because it’s a promise that God made. And He stood by me and told me that, and told me these “fakers would rise up, but hold steady.” I believe It. And no selfish motive, to hurt anybody, but to be reverent to God and to do the work that He called me to do, that’s why I say these things. And God confirms it back, and receives the offer and the sacrifice, by vindicating it to be the Truth. No question to It! Now watch that Word! Now, we notice here, “Seven days,” that’s for every church age. Now, as that Masterpiece had to die, in order to be resurrected to redeem us all. Then He had a church set in order at Pentecost, but that Church had to go through a sacrifice; and the Roman world killed it, put it in the ground. As this author of this book, I can’t think of it now, made so much fun of me, and said, “Of all of the devils, it’s William Branham.” See, that’s what the devil tries to say. He said, “Visions and things,” said, “that’s of the devil.” He said, “Or, he’s some kind of a hypnotist, or working in super sensory perception.” The intellectual world always trying to figure It out. That’s where they tried to figure out Jesus. “How do You do these things? What done it?” He said, “I’ll ask you a question. Was the ministry of John the Baptist … Was it of God or was it of man?” See? Said, “We can’t say.” Said, “Neither do I tell you.” That’s right. They went on. “From henceforth no man asked Him anything.” See? He just cut them off, He didn’t tell them nothing about It; none of their business. He had a work to do and He finished it. God help us to do the same thing. We don’t have to answer the devil’s questions, that’s right, “If thou be, do so-and-so.” You’re responsible for that Gospel, a preacher is, and that’s all; not how It’s written, it’s just responsible for saying It. And as a servant, if you’re a prophet, you’re responsible to God. And if the visions that comes it lightens this Scripture and shows what It is, you’re responsible for every Word that’s in that Bible, ’cause It was all wrote by the same kind of people you are. “God of old moved, by the prophets, and wrote the Ho- … the Holy Bible.” See? And no genuine prophet of God could deny one Word of It, but believe every Word and preach the same. And then God’s obligated out of that channel to make that Word come to pass just exactly the way It’s promised, the Seed will grow. Now notice again, quickly, we find here that all seven days that this bread was to be eat, through Seven Church Ages. Now, when it had to die and go into the ground. And this critic that talked about me, said, “Of a God that you people worship, that could set in the Dark Ages and watch them mothers, pregnant, some of them with little babies in their arms, sincere people, be throwed into the arena and the lions tear them to pieces, and them screaming; hang them upon crosses and burn them; strip the women naked, young virgins, and throw theirselves back like this, and turn lions in on them.” Said, “A God that could set in Heaven, supposed to be on His throne, and looked down and say He enjoys it,” said. Then, see, that’s the intellectual conception which is of the devil. If the man had been spiritual, he would have knowed that that corn of wheat has to die, it had to be buried in a Roman cathedral. But then the first little sprout of Life come forth in the reformation by Martin Luther, that, “The just shall not live by a blessed kosher that a priest does, but by the Word of God. ‘The just shall live by faith!’” He put up two sprigs. The corn of wheat begin to grow. Then along come John Wesley and added to that. (There was many of the others, that … Zwingli and them come forth and denied the virgin birth, and it just died down.) But along come the Methodist, the tassel, the pollen, the missionary day. And they preached sanctification; added the tassel. Then along come the Pentecostals in the shuck, so much, to deceive the Elected. Looked like a real grain of wheat, open it up, there’s no wheat at all. But the Life’s passing through the shuck. Now, have you noticed, every three years after a_a great meeting, what takes place? A denomination. This is twenty years and no denomination. Dear dying Lamb, may it never do that. If I go in this generation, may the people who believe this Message never stand still for a denomination! God will … You’ll die right in your track! Remember that! The very hour that you mention denomination among you, I don’t care how sincere you are, take man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this Word, that’s the hour you die! The genuine Seed cannot, because there’s nothing left after the seed, it’s the same thing was back at the beginning. It’s the Bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again. Notice:  … seven days shall you eat unleavened bread … And there shall be with the Bride … Now, you people that had that old shouting Methodist mother, and so forth, that you wondered “If she didn’t speak in tongues, she ain’t going to be there.” That’s a lie! She was that same Holy Spirit that you have today, but it was in tassel form, not restoration of gifts. But all seven days, just eat the unleavened bread, the Word. Them, back, them that denominated, they’re dead. They’re stalk, they’ll just be gathered and burned. But the Life’s going right on through. And what happens? All the Life that was in the stalk, in the tassel, in the shuck, all winds up in the wheat. And that same Holy Ghost that brought Luther, brought Wesley, brought the Pentecostals, winds up in the Bride at the resurrection. “Seven days, eat unleavened bread.” No leaven shall be found amongst the Bride, no_no word added, no nothing. Remember, one word caused every death that’s in the earth; every illegitimate child was born because Eve, the first church, the bride of the first Adam, doubted God’s Word and accepted a denominational, or a intellectual, or a school exceptions of It; because It was reasoned out, that, “Surely, God is a good God.” God is a good God, but He’s also a just God. We must keep His Word! School, she accepted it. There’s where some of you seminary boys, no doubt a call in your life, but you run off to some Bible school to have this doctrine injected in you, and there’s where you die … Stay with God and His Word. They won’t let you; or, you can’t even belong to their congregation, won’t accept you on the platform. So let them have it, let the dead bury the dead, let’s follow Christ the Word. Now, seven days there shall be no leaven mixed in the Bride, the Church, seven days. Now notice. Now as no … And there shall be no leavened bread seen in thee in all thy coast seven days; … (The sacrifice here is a type: the Bride coming forth from the Sacrifice which is Christ.) … neither shall there be any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificed the first day at evening, … And remember_remember how we just went through the Church Ages? The messenger to the church always comes just at the dying of the other church age, always. The dying of the Pentecost brings forth the rapturing of the Bride. See? The dying of Luther brought forth Wesley. See? The dying of Wesley brought forth Pentecost. The dying of Pentecost brings forth the Message now. Here, it’s right here, patterned all through the Scripture. There’s not a scripture in the Bible but what hooks right one with the other. See? All these types. I have no education, but I have the Holy Spirit that shows me through another channel, that teaches from_from nature; and that’s by the Word. Has to be the Word, things is promised.  … flesh, … the sacrifice the first day … even, remain all night until the morning. Now, even Luther, who had the Truth and taught the church “the just shall live by faith.” You don’t want to hang onto that being the full doctrine, in the Methodist age. What shall you do? Burn it with fire. What was the type of? The denomination that comes out of that Word is a shuck, the stalk, the husks, must be burnt with fire. That denominational part that it come through must not remain, got to die. Don’t leave it till the breaking of another_another age, burn it up! He’s talking now to the Bride here, just the Bride, coming up through every age. Notice how beautiful, “The lamb’s blood.” These are Christ’s Body, the Sacrifice: the lamb’s blood on the door. Now, remember, the lamb was slain which was a type of Christ. Or we could take plenty of time, but I haven’t got … just a few more minutes to stay here. I may just have to stop and start up again tonight, see, because we’re taking too long. It’s … I got twenty pages of this in here, of notes, on this one subject. Notice now, on this, the_the lamb was Christ in figurative form. Or did I say that right? Type; Christ was the Lamb. He was to be a male, the first from the old mother ewe; or yew, which ever one you choose to call it. It must be her first. And he must be tested first to see if there is a blemish on him. Now, Christ was tested; the lamb first from the mother ewe, Mary the virgin. And was tested by what? Satan against the Word. When he hit Eve, she fell; hit Moses, he fell; but when he flew up against Christ, and tried to quote the Scripture to Him wrong, uh-huh, he found out that that wasn’t Moses. See? He was tested. What did … he turn around, he said, “If Thou be the Son of God. Now they tell me You perform miracles, and they tell me that the Messiah’s to do that. Now, if it is, You’re hungry, You haven’t eat, turn these bread into … these stones into bread, and eat.” He said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’” Your creed, so forth. But by what? Every Word! A part of the Word? “Every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” That’s what man lives by. See? The Lamb was tested, see if there’s anywhere He had fallen. The Pharisees, “O Rabbi, You young Prophet, we think You’re wonderful. You are good.” “Why call thou Me good? There’s only one good, and that’s God. Do you believe that?” “Oh, yes. God.” “Well, I am He, then.” Uh-huh. “You said there’s only One good. Why do you call Me ‘good,’ when you don’t believe I’m God?” Uh-huh. “So why do you call Me good? What makes you do that? What inspired you to say that, when you know there’s only one good, and that’s God?” “We know Thou respects not the dignity of man nor the word of their position. We know that.” Try … He knowed that hypocrite. See? He was tested to see where He was standing, see, tested in every manner, tested like we are tested. But there was no giving in, to Him, at all. No, sir! That was the Son of God. And the lamb was tested, and was kept up for fourteen days. That was two Sabbaths, or two ages. One’s for the Jews, which they offered the lamb in type; one’s for the Gentile, who has the real Lamb, and all of them was made perfect by believing this Lamb would come. But He was tempted fourteen … or examined fourteen days, He was the Word. And you can examine the Old Testament, say “It condemns the New.” You’re wrong! The Old Testament only bears record of the New. A man was going to challenge me not long ago, said, “What’s the matter with him?” Said, “Well, he even teaches out of the Old Testament.” A Christian preacher, think of that. Said, “The Old Testament’s dead and gone.” Oh, no! Oh, no! It’s only a schoolmaster, it shows what’s wrote on the wall. See? That’s right. Now, see, fourteen days it was tested, that was Christ. Now notice, then He was killed in the evening time, should be killed, the lamb was. Christ died in the evening time, the afternoon. And then notice, then he was also … The blood was to be put on the doorposts, see, which the blood is the life of the animal. “Thou shall eat the flesh thereof; but the blood thereof which is the life, pour it out.” See? It was to be … The blood was to be put on the lintel of the doorposts of the house wherein the sacrifice was accepted. Glory! What is the Life? The Name. That … He placed the name of the person … Go up to the door, and you look, see what name’s on the door before you ring the bell. See? The blood was put on the lintel of the door as a type of what the sacrifice was on the inside. Now we’re going to find the place of worship, right through there, coming through that Blood. Notice, the blood on the door was speaking the name of what was going … was on the inside, they were in there. Our place of worship, the Lamb, is the Word. We know that. Now, verse 4, notice, “Leave no bread, leave none of the sacrifice,” or, take one from one age to another. Try to go back and say, “Well, now, we’re Lutherans, we want to come up here,” you’ve got to die to the Lutheran age to be borned in the Wesley age. You have to die in the Wesley age to be borned in a Pentecostal age. And you have to die in the Pentecostal age, leave nothing of it left, burn it with fire, because it’s going to be burnt like the stalk that the wheat comes up out of. The stalk, the denomination, it’s got to be burned. So don’t bring your denomination over in the new Message. This is the Word now. That’s what denominated, the stalk; it carried It, that’s right; but It come over into here, then the stalk died. It was a carrier, the denomination, but the Word goes right on. Yeah, the Word goes right on. Now take the 5th and the 6th verse. Notice, “Not … ” Now let’s take the 5th and the 6th verse. Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of the gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee: Now remember, “Not in any of these gates.” The Lord permits you to have these denominations, see, “these gates.” But at the place which the LORD … God shall choose to place his name in, … That’s the Gate, the only place. “Not in any of these gates.” But God has a Gate. You say, “Every morning I enter the Methodist gate.” That’s the church. “Every morning I go into the Catholic gate.” Uh-huh. Well, the Lord let His people go in and out them gates. God’s got people in the Catholic church, Methodist church, Presbyterian church, all of them, Pentecostals. Sure, but don’t … you don’t worship the Lord in that gate. See? But the Lord has a certain gate. Glory! He has a gate. But at the place which the LORD thy God … choose to place his name in, there … shall thou sacrifice the passover at evening, … When did Rebekah find Isaac? When did Eliezer call her to be the bride? Evening time! It shall be Light about the evening time, The way to Glory you will surely find; In that water way is the Light today, Buried in the precious Name of Jesus; Young and old, repent of all your sins, The Holy Ghost will surely enter in; The evening Lights have come, It is a fact that God and Christ are one. That was the beginning of It, now she’s faded on into the Bride Light. See what I mean? I better close here, start again tonight, ’cause I don’t want you to leave this, you see. No, no, it’s_it’s dinner time. Well, well, I got too many notes wrote here. Oh, my! How about tonight, would that be better? [Congregation says, “No. Now.” _ Ed.] Huh? Well, if you … You want to just try a little further? [“Yes. Amen.”] All right, let’s go a little further then, we’ll hurry right quick. How’s that? Now, go in at the what? “You shall not go into any gate that the Lord God has given you, but at the gate that the Lord will put His Name in.” Not go into the house of the_of the gate which is the door. That right? God’s going to put His Name at the door, and you shall not … That’s the gate that enters into the place of worship, the sanctuary. You don’t go in there with your sacrifice to any of these gates, but in the gate that the Lord God chooses to put His Name in. See? Now, has He did that? Where is that gate? In Saint John 10, Jesus said, “I am the gate, the door. I am the door to the House of God. I am a door to the sheepfold.” Not the goatfold, the sheepfold. See? “I am the door to the sheepfold. A man may enter into this door, be safe.” And now we could linger a long time on that. But, to save time, He is the door to that sheepfold. Now, we want to notice here. The shadows and types are really in view right here, but I … if I take that page I’d … it’s going to hold you awhile. All right, notice, this brings in perfect view, Jesus Christ. For all the Old Testament is type of Him, all the feasts, all the worships, and everything. And I’ve got wrote down here, under these line of Scriptures, “Explain it.” There’s where it’d take a long time. Explain how all the feasts … Even the meal offering was a type of Christ. Let’s just take that one. One time there was a_a school called the school of the ministers, or school of prophets. They trained up, educated prophets. And there was a genuine, God-called prophet one time went up to visit them. Well, they wanted to show the old prophet a little courtesy, so one of them went out and picked a big bunch of what he thought to be peas; but they were poison gourds, and he was going to feed them all on that. Oh! How many seminary lapfuls have we had! See? Right. They’re cooking up something. See? Got Methodist lapfuls, Baptist lapfuls, Pentecostal lapfuls. But, you see, they are the second growth, the kind that can be pruned off the tree. See, not in the main Vine. Bearing lemons, grapefruit, and so forth; not oranges, but professing to be citrus. Notice again. Now, in this_in this, when Elijah come around and looked at them, and seen that it was poison gourds that would kill every one of them, they said, “Alas, we got death in the pot!” He said, “Bring me a handful of meal.” And he throwed meal into it, he said, “Now it’s all right, eat what you want.” It changed death to life. And the meal offering that was given to … Christ, He was the Meal offering, and the meal offering must be ground with a certain burr that made every little chunk of meal the same, shows that He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever. He’s the same thing to put in your denomination and it’ll live, the Word! Christ is the Word, all the types of everything: the tabernacle, the_the_the shewbread, everything. The broken kosher under the plate was His broken body, that the Jews can’t explain yet why they do it. See? And all these other things typed Him. Now, then, Him in view, we see now all denominations and creeds left behind; for He is the pure, unchangeable Word of God, which is the unleavened bread, Saint John 1. That’s right, He’s the unleavened Bread. So when you add this or add that, it’s a leaven added to That what’s already been originally give for you. Looky here. What’s killing the race today? They take and hybrid things. And when you hybrid it, you kill it. “Oh, it looks more pretty.” Sure! Hybrid corn: corn flakes, all the other cereals that comes out of corn. Hybrid corn: great, big, nice long stalks, and great big ears, look like twice as good as the other. But it’s death! Science even found that out. See? Don’t cross it, it’ll kill you. Now, here, let me show you. The other day I was watering some flowers in my yard. And the lady had some hybrid flowers that was in the little pot here, or little planter at the side of the house. We have to water them things at least three times a week, or four, or they’ll die. And there stood the original plant out in the yard. It hasn’t rained there for six months, just as dry … If it rains, in ten minutes you can blow a dust. But that little fellow laying out there, just prettier and brighter than the hybrid was with all the water. You keep that water off of him, he’ll die. But where did he get his water? And another thing, you have to go all along spraying them every day or two, to keep the lice off of them. They don’t, the lice will eat him up, he’s so tender and soft. But there ain’t a louse that’ll get on that original. No, no! He’ll crawl up to him and crawl away. He’s original! See what the hybriding has done? That’s the same thing in the church. They’re trying to mix the denomination with the Word, to make the … try to make the Word say what the denomination says. And when you do that, you have to spray them, and baby them, and_and give them gold stars to come to Sunday school, and everything else. That’s right. When, a genuine, born-again Christian, born with the Word of God, he’s rugged. That’s you. The lice and things of the world don’t bother him. He’s an eagle, he flies plumb past it. See, soars in the heavenly. See? It is true. Nothing … Notice. Now, we must understand that here, the denomination, creeds, and anything that’s added of the leavened bread cannot mix with the unleavened bread. And the Bible foreshadows here in the sacrament, of going into the worship, that no unleaven can be taken with you, and God will receive it. You say, “I’m Methodist.” Right there you die! “I’m Pentecostals.” You die! I am of Christ. That’s right. You’ve got to stand on something. That’s right. You’re_you’re standing on something. Churchill once said, held up two fingers and said, “We are got the victory.” And England stood by that, they believed Churchill. And believe it or not, this morning, you are standing by something. There’s only one thing that you can live and stand by, and that’s Christ, the Word. True! Notice, nothing in the Bible types the denominations but Babylon. And Babylon was founded by Nimrod, and Nimrod was a renegade. And he had a bunch of women in there, was supposed to be his queens, that was prophetess. They even think that old Balaam come from that section, they had roots and so forth. They worshipped, you know (many of you scholars that reading Hislop’s Two Babylons, and so forth, and the history of the church), and how they_they did. And they had women that done this, and women … a goddess, and everything, and it was a forced religion. Everybody, every city around Babylon was compelled to come to Babylon to worship under Nimrod at the tower. See? That’s right. They were forced to do it, debate it. There’s where the confusion come. And that’s exactly what the church is today, “If you don’t attend Sunday school, if you don’t do this, and have to hire you to do this and do this and do that, you’re out of the picture.” Out there in Tucson, is listening in this morning, I once wondered … I’ve always constraining people, “Go to church, no matter where you go.” And I seen the people kind of pulling back, and going this way. And I thought, “What’s the matter?” I went to some of them, “The first day you’re there, they’ll approach you, ‘Join our church.’ If you don’t do it, you’re not welcome.” See? See? It’s a forced thing, it’s forced upon you, see, and that’s Babylon. But in Christ, you come in by election; not by force, your heart pulls you in. God did not put His name then in Babylon. Closely now. He cannot put His Name in Babylon, the churches. Oh, they, they put His Name in there, but He never. No. You say, “Well, now, Brother Branham!” Wait, wait, just sit still just a minute. You asked me to stay a little longer. Can’t you see? Now notice, they put His Name in there, but He didn’t. Now, He said, “The place that I’m going to meet you and receive your sacrifice is where I choose to put My Name. You come in at this gate, this door where I choose to put My Name. There’s where you come.” Well, they put, “This is the church of Christ.” If there’s anything that’s wrong in that declaration, it left out one word: “anti.” Uh-huh, all that He taught, they disagree with It. Modern Pharisees. But we must find where He did put His Name, for in It is His only provided gate. Amen! Glory! Watch! Where did He put His Name? In His Son. “Oh,” you say, “now wait a minute, Brother Branham. That was the Son, not the Father.” The son always takes the name of his father in every case. I come to this earth in the name of a Branham because my father’s name was Branham. Jesus said, “I came in My Father’s Name, and you received Me not.” You want the Scripture on that? St. John 5:43. See? “I_I came in My Father’s Name, and you received Me not.” Then the Father put His Own Name, which is “Jesus,” in the Son. And He’s the Way, He’s the Door, He’s the House, He’s where God chose to put His Name. God never put His Name in me, He never put It in the church, He never put It in the Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, but He put It in Christ the Anointed Emmanuel. And the Name is in the Word because He is the Word. Amen! What is He then? The Word interpreted is the manifestation of the Name of God. No wonder. “Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you, Who I am. And upon this rock I’ll build My place of worship, and the gates of hell can’t shake It down.” Amen! O living Church of God, stand in firm foundation on Jesus Christ alone. You can sing the song, but if you’re not on Christ the Word, you’re a teetering, faltering sand. “But upon this rock,” Christ, “My Word.” He built the Lutheran message and they denominated it. It was growing, the footstool. Then He growed up into the leg part, the Methodist, and so forth. There’s where He built His Church, upon His Word! Now, He’s not all foot or all thigh, He’s a body; and now is the capping part. Did you notice in the pyramids? Which, I don’t preach a pyramid religion, now. But the first Bible was ever wrote, was wrote in the sky, the zo- … [Blank spot on tape _ Ed.] Did you notice it? It starts off with the virgin, the first figure in the zodiac. The last figure is Leo the lion. He come first by the virgin, He comes next as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Just before that, a cancer age, a cross fish, all the rest the ages. If we had time to go through it; which we have, at the tabernacle. And the pyra- … pyramid being those foundations, up into the king’s chamber. And just before you hit the seventh wall, there’s a little introduction plank there, where a messenger comes out to bring you to the king. (The messenger, John the Baptist, that introduced, to the King.) But the Headstone was rejected. And they don’t know, the Stone of Scone, or whatever it is, they don’t know where it’s at, because it’s a rejected stone. But that’s the stone that caps the whole thing, that makes it the pyramid through the complete seven church ages. Add grace, add this, add this, there’s seven adds, the last one is Christ. Add this to your charity, add grace to your grace, add something else, and something else, till it gets up to Christ is the Headstone, “And I am the door.” Now, a son always comes in his father’s name. Any son comes in his father’s name. And Jesus said, “I came in My Father’s Name.” Then what is the Name of the Father? What is the Name of the Son? And He said, “A little while and the world seeth Me no more, yet ye shall see Me.” Yeah, He’s come in the form of the Holy Ghost, that same Jesus. That was the reason they was worshipping, “O Jesus!” See? See? Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: It’s the Lord Jesus Christ. That’s all. “I come in My Father’s Name, and you received Me not.” Now, remember, He also added here and warns us, “another will come,” a denomination, a creed. “They’ll come in their name and you will receive them. You won’t receive Me, the Word vindicated and proved before you.” As He was right then, so is He today. Don’t you miss that, people across this nation! “Another will come, a church, and you’ll believe that, because you can just do any way. I won’t vindicate it.” He’s never (at any time, ever) vindicated anything (in any church) outside of the Message that was given: Luther’s, justification; Wesley, sanctification; Pentecostal, restoration of the gifts. After …  And as soon as they make a denomination out of it, there it died. Search the Scriptures. But He said, “I’ll choose the place to put My Name.” And the Name was Jesus. And Jesus is the Word, Saint John 1. Is that right? That’s the place of worship, in Christ the Word. “I come in My Father’s Name.” The prophet said, “His Name shall be called Emmanuel.” That’s Matthew 1:23, if you want to wrote that down. Jesus, Jehovah, the Saviour. Now, the 5th verse shows that He is the door. By now, many other invisible proofs, this gate, and Name, and place can be proved to be there’s only one place that God meets man to worship, and that’s when he’s in Christ. Now, now the question is, “How do we get in Him?” Now, this may pinch just a little bit; but, you know, like taking medicine, if it don’t make you sick, it don’t do you no good. See? Now, the Lutherans wanted to get in one way, by joining the Lutheran church. The Methodist wanted to get in by shouting. The Pentecostals wanted to get in by speaking in tongues. That still ain’t it! See? No, that’s gifts, so forth. But First Corinthians 12 says, “By one Spirit.” Spirit of God, which is the Life-giver to the Word (the Seed), to vindicate that Seed for that season. See? Here’s the Methodist-age seed laying there, it taken the Holy Spirit to make that seed come to life and pure … purify the church by sanctification; Luther didn’t preach that, ’cause he didn’t know it. The Pentecostals wanted to speak in tongues for the restoration of the gifts. Each one declares, “That’s It! That’s It!” See? “But by one Spirit we’re all baptized into one Body,” and that Body is a family, the family of God. And that’s the house of God, and the house of God is the Name of Jesus Christ. “The Name of the Lord is a mighty tower, the righteous run into It and are safe.” Now, how you going to come in by a title? How’s your check going to be received by saying, “Paid to the order of_of Reverend, Doctor, Minister”? See? See? You might be a reverend, doctor, minister. But the name of the Lord is “Jesus Christ.” See? “I have chose to put My Name at the door of the house of My worship, for My family will be gathered in there under the Blood; like it was in Egypt, anything outside died. And in there there’s no leavened bread! There’s no denominational mixture in It anywhere, My house! My children, borned of My genes!” Amen! Glory to God! “My genes are in them! My … I put My Word in them. I’ll write them upon the tables of their heart. That’s My family, the family of the Body of Jesus Christ; the family. And this door you’ll come in, not Methodist, Baptist, or Pentecostal, but in the door where I put My Name.” It ain’t Methodist. God’s Name ain’t Methodist. God’s Name ain’t Pentecostal. God’s Name ain’t Baptist. God’s Name ain’t Catholic. Stay out of the doors then. See? See? See? “But in a place where I choose to put My Name.” Now, there’s not another place in the Bible given where that God ever put His Name, only in Jesus Christ, for He is the Son of God taking the Name of God, and God’s human Name. “And there’s not another name given under Heaven whereby you must be saved.” I don’t care, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, catechisms, or whatever you want to do; only through the Name of Jesus Christ where every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to it, Him being Lord. There’s how you come in. And if you were just baptized in water right_right, and then deny the Word, then you’re illegitimate; your birth wasn’t correct. You claim that you believed Him then, and you deny Him. How could I deny my family? When … How could I deny Charles Branham being my father? A blood test on the door shows it. Uh-huh. My action, and the vindication of God’s Word in my life shows whether I’m a child of God or not. Now, there’s God’s only place. See it? The only place that God will receive your sacrifice (I don’t care how sincere you are) is in Christ. And remember … You say, “Well, I believed I come in too.” Remember, the Bible says … You say, “Well, the Bible said, ‘Whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, is saved, shall be saved.’” It says that, but remember it also is written, also is written, “No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Ghost.” See? You might say “He is,” but He isn’t until the Holy Spirit Itself which gives Life to the Word proves it by vindication that you are the son of God. That’s the Scripture. “The place that I chose to put My Name. You shall not worship in any other gate, but in the gate I put My Name in; then I will receive you, you’re in My family.” Now, the family of God obeys the order of the Father of the family. “And He is the Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, the everlasting Father; and of His dominion and reign there shall be no end, the government shall be upon His shoulders.” And Him being Governor, King, Emmanuel, First, Last, Prince of Peace, the Mighty God, everlasting Father, every one of His children obey every Word to the order because they’re a part of Him. We live in our home like Branhams live. You live in your home, the Joneses, like the Joneses live. And in the House of God we live by the Word of God and every One that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; and any other, fraud, we won’t listen to him. See? “You shall eat unleavened bread, every church age, just as I give It to you.” But don’t try to go back and inject that over into This, because it’s come into a stalk. “You shall take the bones and things that’s left over of the sacrifice and burn them!” Gone, the church age died, went on; we’re in another one now. Amen! “The place I choose to put My Name in.” Oh, my! First Corinthians 12. Notice Ephesians 4:30.  … grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the … (next revival?) … until the day of your redemption.  … grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. Now notice. Let’s apply that to our Scripture lesson. Then we better go; I think I’m wearing the people out. See? [Someone says, “No, you ain’t, Brother Branham.” _ Ed.] Look here, people getting up and going home, you see, so they got_they got dinner cooking, and somebody they’re wanting to meet. They didn’t expect come down here to listen all day long. See? But, look, you know the … [Brother Ben Bryant said something _ Ed.] Ben, oh, I ought to work on you! Bless you! Thank you, Brother Ben. I love you, Brother Ben. If you know what that boy’s suffered for us in that war; he’s shot all to pieces, and blowed up, and everything else. He’s had a life of everything, but God’s blessed him. He stayed true. His wife left him, run away and married again, and took his children. Oh, my, I just can’t think about it. But, anyhow, God bless you, Ben. He’s laying right now full of shrapnel, pressing against his nerves and everything else. Just … You have to know the background of Ben, you see. God bless that boy. Yes.  … whereby you’re sealed until the day of your redemption. Notice! Now this might pinch just a little bit, but notice. Don’t fall out with me. Just remember. When Israel once looked on that door, with that blood on the door, the name (the blood, the life), and entered in under that blood, they never went out again until they went out of Egypt.  … grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you go in and don’t go out anymore until the day that you are redeemed out. (See?) You know, the Bible is always right. He puts Words in There, you’ve got to place It out where It goes, to make It, make the whole picture of redemption. See? See? … grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed until your redemption. (Till you’re redeemed.) You’re sealed in there, you’re beneath the Blood. You don’t go out no more. And then what are you? God’s son in God’s family, sealed in by the Holy Spirit. The devil couldn’t get you if he had to; for you are dead, your old husband part is dead; and you are buried, and your life is hid in God through Christ, and sealed by the Holy Ghost. See? How is he going to get you? How you going to get out? You’re there! Glory! Now I’ll leave that alone; just enough so you’ll know what I’m talking about. Then a new creation, not to a denomination but to the Word. You’re a creation of the Word. Because the foundation stone was laid in you before the foundation of the world, predestinated to be sons and daughters of God. And upon this come stone upon stone, in each age, to vindicate that Word that’s coming up, just exactly as Jesus did in His age, which is, the Capstone of it all. In Him laid every age. In Jesus was Moses. In Jesus was David. In Jesus was the prophets. Is that right? Look at Joseph, sold for almost thirty pieces of silver, throwed in, supposed to be dead, taken out, went and come to the right hand of Pharaoh. Look, exactly, Jesus was … Joseph was in Jesus. And when He come, He was the fullness of the kings, prophets (hallelujah), the godhead bodily rested in Him. He come to redeem out of there a Bride, a Masterpiece. A Masterpiece that says to Satan that … When he says, “Days of miracles is past. There’s no such a thing as these things you’re talking about.” “Get thee behind me, Satan.” See? See, a Masterpiece standing and a guarding. Sometime the Capstone will return, the head of all of it, and receive the Bride unto Himself; which the woman is took from the man, a part of the man. Every … Genes of the man is in the woman, what makes the woman. And that’s the way the Word of God is in the Church, what makes the Church the Bride. Not a denomination, that’s of the devil, every one of them. I ain’t calling the people in there that; they are poor deceived people, like Jesus said, “Blind leading the blind.” And He could not call them out. And they said, “Why, you are born of fornication! Who tells you to come to here? What school, what seminary recognized you?” Said, “We have Moses. We are … ” He said, “If you’d have knowed Moses, you’d have knowed Me.” Cause Moses wrote Him in his four books, “The Lord your God shall raise up a Giver of the Word, a Prophet likened unto me, and who will not hear that Prophet will be cut off from amongst the people.” That’s all there is to it. And what is He? The Word. And what is It? Don’t leave none of the leaven left in the … Just don’t put no leaven amongst It. Don’t add any creed, any denomination, for it’s polluted right there, your sacrifice is finished. Let’s hurry now, right quick, so you can go eat. Notice! Now, then, you are a son of God, in the house of God, you are a part of God’s economy. Romans 8:1, “Then there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.” For they are dead to the world, alive in Him, and living in this present day, making the Word that God has used them, or foreordained them, placing their names in this Bride Book. And when the Waters comes upon that seed that’s in the heart, raises it up to the Bride of Christ. Oh, my! Just perfect as it can be. In every age it’s been that way. The Lutherans, under justification, the feet, raised it like that; Wesley, under sanctification. The Pentecostals under the arms, the works and deeds and so forth, had to be Calvinists … or had to be Arminian, had to be legalists. But now we come to the head, the capstone. “Grace! Grace!” the capstone cried. The headstone crying what? “Grace! Grace!” Passed from death and creed, into a living Word of the living God. God’s only provided plan for His age, His sons in the Word age quickened by the Spirit like a spark that’s lit off of something to make it alive; and seated now in heavenly places (in present tense), already alive and subject to every promise in the Word. Then what does that do? You being a part of God’s gene, a part of the Word, other men a part of God’s Word, seated together, manifest the entire Body of Christ, because there’s no leaven among you. (See what He’s talking about, Brother Brown?) No leaven among you, just the Word only, seated in heavenly places, in the door where He put His Name: Christ Jesus. No leaven among you, that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you. Couldn’t do it in Luther’s age, couldn’t do it in Wesley’s age, couldn’t do it in Pentecostal age; but in the day when the Son of man will be manifested, revealed, brought back the Church together with the entire Deity of God amongst His people, showing the same visible signs, manifesting Himself like He did at the beginning when He was manifested on earth in a form of a Prophet-God. Oh! Glory! Promised by Malachi 4, promised by the rest of the Scriptures. Where you worship at? The house of God, seated (in present tense). Now, quickly, let us look just real fast now, and then go on about … In ten minutes we’ll be gone, the Lord willing. Now let us look at some that has been quickened into this house of God, of their age. Enoch! (In ten minutes we’ll go, if you can just suffer that much longer.) Look, Enoch was the living Word of God of his age, he was a prophet. A prophet is God’s reflector. How many knows that? The_the reflector doesn’t reflect itself, the_the reflector isn’t the reflection. There has to be something strike the reflector_reflector to make it reflect. So a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he’s in direct line with that reflection, God, to reflect the image of Christ, the Word. See, nothing else can do it. You are a reflector, that’s the reason the prophet had to eat the book. That’s the reason he had to eat the scroll. He had to reflect that Word for that age. You got it? Notice Enoch, God’s perfect reflector in type. When God was through_through with him, He just translated him, took him up. The mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics with the Spirit, and took him up. Same in the days of Elijah. Elijah, even to his bones, where that reflection … Reflector of God in his body being made manifest the Word of God. They laid a dead man on it, he sparked to life again. We are flesh and bone of Him, as long as we are the Bride of Christ. Do you believe that? All right. He died for us, and we died to ourselves and are buried in His Name, that we would “no more be of the world, but in Him,” of which both the family in Heaven is named after Jesus Christ. That’s Ephesians 1:21. For both Heaven … the family in Heaven. What’s the family in Heaven named? Jesus. What’s the family on earth named? Well, that’s the house of God where the Blood’s at. Is that right? That’s the door, that’s the gate, that’s the place He put His Name, and the Word was made flesh and dwelled among us. It’s the Word reflecting and sparking off the age that you’re living in. That’s what He was, that’s what Moses was, that’s what Jacob was, that’s what the rest of them was, sparking off that Word of God, the reflector that God was reflecting Himself. And come to that perfect image of God, Jesus Christ, God’s Masterpiece; was struck that He might take the rest of them for a Bride that’s been reflectors. Moses was in Him. Joshua was in Him. And if you are in Him, you was in Him before the foundation of the world, the family of God; you suffered with Him, you died with Him, you went to the cross with Him, you raised with Him; and now you’re still with Him, setting in Heavenly places, reflecting the Message of the age to the world, the Light of the world. “Ye are the Light of the world,” but if it’s hid by a denominational bushel basket, how are they going to see It? For your traditions, you make the Light of no effect! By trying … You denominationals, trying to keep the Light away from your church; you won’t go in, neither will you let them. Amen. Let’s just stop. My, I got too much here. We_we could go on … Oh, my! Five minutes we got. You see who the door is? Where did God put His Name? In Jesus. How do you get in His Name? How do you get in there? By being baptized in there! How? By water? By Spirit! “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.” That’s Holy Ghost baptism. The water baptism just put you in fellowship with the people, that you recognized that you have accepted Christ. That’s the Truth. But it’s Spirit baptism. I can call the Name of Jesus over you and baptize you, that doesn’t make it so. But when once that Holy Spirit really … genuine Word comes into you (the Word, Jesus), then, brother, the Message is no secret to you then; you know It, brother, It’s all lit up before you. Hallelujah! Praise be to God! Amen! I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me, And purchased my salva- … Dear God, I pray that You will heal these people, Lord, and make each one of them well. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. Oh! Love! Oh! Ever since, by faith I saw that stream Thy flowing wounds supplied, (from that Masterpiece) Redeeming love has been my theme, How can you … God is Love. “He that loveth is of God,” divine, holy love, not dirty love; clean, pure, holy love, love of God the Word. “Thy laws have I hid in my heart, that I sin not against Thee,” oh, my, that David crying out. Isn’t He wonderful? Don’t you love Him? Now, there is a Way, a pure, holy Way, a only meeting place that God will meet you. Not because you say, “God, now, I’m a good Methodist. I’m a good Baptist. I’m a good Pentecostal.” No! Because that you are in Jesus the Word, the part of the Word that’s being manifested to today, this day’s Message; not Luther’s, Wesley’s, Pentecostal; but your Jesus, the reflection, that has come up into this. You can’t go back to that, that’s adding leaven to your holy Bread, that, “Man shall live by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God, in Its season.” O come, Lord Jesus, the great Headstone. Look laying yonder, the dust of them Lutherans that died back yonder under martyrdom; look at them Methodist. Those Pentecostals and so forth, coming up now, that real strain that come out. You Assemblies of God went and organized, when the very thing God brought you out of, you turned right back like a hog to its wallow. You Oneness united, the old J.C. of … Pentecostal Assemblies of Jesus Christ. One for the colored, and separated yourselves because of segregation. You that did that, and then united yourself and call it “United.” And then organized, and fussed at the Assemblies: “As a dog turns to its vomit.” If the vomit made the dog sick in the first place, won’t it make him sick again? Change your diet from your denomination to the Word, and live with Christ. Shame on you! I’ve got a Father over yonder, I’ve got a Father over yonder, I’ve got a Father over yonder, On the other shore. Some bright day I’ll go and see Him, Some bright day … go and see Him, Some bright day I’ll go and see Him, On the other shore. Oh, won’t that be a happy meeting, Won’t that … (Word goes to Word!) meeting, (When the Bride goes up, Word by Word.) … happy meeting, On the other shore. Oh, that bright day may be tomorrow, That bright day may be tomorrow, That bright day may be tomorrow, On the other shore. You say, “You mean that, Brother Branham?” Yes, sir! When the Lutheran of that age, the Wesley’s of their age, the pentecostals of their age (the true ones, not the denominationals); the Pentecostals, the one that added leaven (their denomination), died. But this true Word moving on, see. Just like Jesus said, “At that day, you will know that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me, and I in you and you in Me.” It’s all the Word! Oh, won’t that be a happy meet- … (when His sons gather to His gate)  … happy meeting, Won’t that be a happy meeting, On the other shore. Now, church, we’re teaching now. But, remember, when you leave here, start moving out of the shuck now; you’re going into the grain, but lay in the Presence of the Son. Don’t add, what I’ve said; don’t take away, what I’ve said. Because, I speak the Truth as far as I know It, as the Father has given to me. See? Don’t add to It, just say what I said. The thing of it is, just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus. And then you yourselves lay right in His Presence, just make love to Him, “O Lord Jesus, Son of God, I love You. Tender my heart, Lord. Take away all the filth and the love of the world, and let me live holy in this present world before You.” Shall we bow our heads for prayer. Now, let’s see, have we got anybody chosen to dismiss in prayer? Or, I will, then. Be real reverent. Dear God, we thank You that we have had our spiritual diet. We thank You, Lord, that the vitamin of the Word grows sons of God. It does not affect on any other type of character, only on sons and daughters of God. So we thank You for It. And we pray, God, that we will profit therewith, that we will not only thank Thee. We thank You for It, but may we use the strength to try to (by Love) persuade people to believe in our God; the wayward, the sinners, the women, the men, the boys, the girls, in this age. Seeing, Lord, that the mental conditions, the nervous age that the people’s living in, it’s driving them out of their mind; to exactly fulfill what the Scripture said and promised, the great hideous things would come upon the earth; like locusts, to haunt the women that cut their hair, they’ll have long hair like a woman. And different hideous sights that they’ll be able to see, Lord, in that mental, deluded conditions they’re in, and then screaming for the rocks and the mountains. Women who would mother dogs and cats, and not raise children to honor You. Those that You did give children to and they did conceive them, turn them loose on the streets to do as they want. No wonder You said, Lord, when You were going to the cross, “Then they’ll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them.” We see every other thing moving right up to this time. We see the Scripture being vindicated, proved. And just as we see That, Lord, You with our own eyes (being made manifest), some day there will be a Rapture and we’ll see the manifestation of that Word, “For the Son of man shall come in the clouds of glory, with His holy Angels with Him, and we’ll be caught up to meet Him in the air.” It will then … We hear of it now, then we’ll see it with our own eye. May we be found in Him, Lord, the only provided place. And He is the sacrifice. We bring Him, what we’ve heard about, Jesus Christ, into the house of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, through the Name of Jesus Christ. And there our sacrifice is accepted and we’re brought into the family; because, yet straying out in the world, we were ordained sons and daughters of God before the foundation of the world. Thank You for that, Father. Oh, how could anyone ever turn back on something like that, when they found the Truth, that God had selected them out of the world? There were millions lost, the day that I was saved. O dying Lamb, how can I ever thank You? How can my heart ever be reverent enough before You? Help me, dear God, to live true. Help my people to live true. I pray for them, Lord, every one, that You will. God, somehow, I don’t … I wouldn’t know how … I don’t know how, just how to ask, Lord; and maybe I’m not even asking that in the right manner. But You forgive my ignorance, Lord, and just look at my heart. I pray that not one of them will be lost, not one of them, Father. I claim them, every one, for You. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I love Him, I … And if you love Him, you love one another. Shake one another’s hand.  
Let’s bow our heads. Dear Lord, we thank Thee tonight for the promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus, where we’ll meet in a great meeting where it’ll never end, of joys and songs, as we praise You through the—the ceaseless ages that is to come. We ask Your blessings upon the meeting tonight. We ask Your blessings upon this tabernacle, upon its staff, its pastors, its co-workers, co-pastors, and all. We ask You to bless these, Lord, who have come many miles to be in the meeting, lay Your hand of mercy upon them as they travel back to their homes. Grant it, Lord. May we meet many more times together in this place called the house of God, to worship. Bless those who are tuned in tonight, Lord, by the way of the telephone. May every unsaved person find Jesus Christ their Saviour, tonight; heal all the sick and the afflicted, Father, Your servant is reporting for service, in Jesus’ Name. Amen! The Lord bless each of you. So happy to be here tonight. I just got in when Brother Ernie was singing the last part of his song, On The Wings Of A Dove. Certainly beautiful poem, certainly beautiful, and I—I know it’s timely. So now, we very thankful. And to all you people that’s tuned in tonight out across the nation, I wished you were only here to see this waiting, expectations on the people’s faces as they’re jammed in the building tonight; having a wonderful time. We want to thank Brother Jack Moore, and Sister Moore, and Brother Noel, Brother Boutliere, Brother Brown, all these associates here, the whole tabernacle, the whole staff, for inviting us back. It was a … really a … kind of a … couldn’t say a coincident, it was simply just the hand of God that worked it out. There’s a brother here that had a dream sometime ago, about this thing happening, said I “was standing in a pair of white trousers, in Indian moccasins.” And that’s just exactly the way I was standing when I called Brother Jack for the meeting here, just exactly, (at Carson, Colorado) Indian moccasins and a pair of white levi trousers on; Brother Leo, if you’re listening in, I was just meeting you in a few minutes. So that’s when the meeting took its birthplace, right there. Now it’s Sunday night; I know many of you will drive all night tonight going home, some of you will be driving in the morning. I’ve got two days drive ahead of me. And so we—we won’t hold you very long. And I’ve tried to make this an old-time night, the night that Brother Brown, and Brother Jack, and all of us that used to pray for the sick years ago, would pray for the sick in the same manner that we did then. Now, can you hear me back in the back? I just keep lowering these mics because I am hoarse. And so I want to … Just a little something, this little incident’s happened. Why, they was telling me a while ago that there was a brother, perhaps here in the meeting tonight, that just come out of denominationalism; come into Shreveport, wanted to hear about the Message. And he got mixed up, he didn’t know where he was at, so he went downtown. He seen a people gathered, he said, “Is this where Billy Branham is going to preach?” He said, “No, it’s where Billy Graham’s preaching by—by the way of a—a film.” He said, “Well, I’m sorry, I—I got the wrong place.” He said he come up, he said, “Now where can I go, Lord?” Said he started walking up this main street. I don’t know what it is, there’s a big church up here at the end. Texas Street. And there was a big white cross up on a church. Said the Lord told him, said, “‘Just keep walking.’” Said … when he got there, there was … Said, “Well, here must be where it is, there’s a lot of cars setting around.” And said, “A bride and groom come walking out of the church.” That was last night, there was a wedding, I seen it come out. The Lord said, “Now, that’s what it is. You’re coming out of denominationalism to enter into the Bride, to go with the Groom.” See? See? I was remarking to my wife, coming down the street, how the moon and the star hanging right above that cross, as we moved up into it. I guess I just look at little things like that, maybe kind of complimentary to my belief in God and my ministry. I was thinking tonight, in Tucson, it happens to be that Victor Le Doux, he was this Frenchman … he’s a genuine Frenchman. I believe I was telling you the other day, that when I got through speaking, trying to separate denominationalism from real Christianity … And a man was giving me a … kind of a short talk about it, from a famous denominational Pentecostal church. And so Danny Henry, I think he’s some movie star’s cousin or something, and he was a Baptist; and he run down to the platform, and just threw his arms around me and said, “Brother Branham, I hope this don’t sound sacrilegious, but that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation.” And when he started to say something else, he started speaking in tongues. And this, three French people … A French woman (big, heavyset woman, dark complected, from Louisiana, she may be setting here tonight) wrote it down on a piece of paper, what he said. Then Victor Le Doux, a minister, wrote down the same thing; and they were comparing notes, or going to. A light-headed man (kind of a blond hair) standing way back, packed back as far as he could, come walking up, wanted to see those notes. He was the interpreter of French at the U.N. And all three notes was the same. And It said this: Because thou has chosen this harder way … You’ve chose it, you have took … chose it by your own choosing. Course, we know that. Moses had to make his choice. Said: This is the precise and correct way, because it’s MY WAY. And what a—what a glorious decision you’ve made! Said: Because of this, a large portion of Heaven awaits you. And this in itself is that which will make, and bring to pass, the tremendous victory in the Love Divine. All three was the same. I thought I had that in my Bible tonight, (I looked in there, but I didn’t), the original copy of it. Danny Henry don’t know … like myself, he hardly knows good English, let alone French. If you notice in there, it’s like the French language, they put the verb before the adverb. And the interpretation of all three was exactly alike. Danny Henry, sometime ago, he make … Danny may be listening in tonight. Victor Le Doux perhaps is, because I understand he’s in Tucson. And you people in Tucson at the church, the tabernacle, the Tucson Tabernacle where Brother Green’s the pastor; Brother Victor Le Doux, I understand is in a tent meeting right at the foot of Park Avenue where it runs out into Highway 80, coming this a-way. And if you’re out there tomorrow night and next night, whenever how long he’ll be there, go to hear him; and Danny may be with him. And it could be that they’re listening in from the tabernacle tonight, I don’t know. Danny went to Jerusalem right after that, and said he was laying there in the tomb on the board … rock board that Jesus laid on, a corpse just before His resurrection. And said, all of a sudden I come on his mind; and said he run out, begin crying, and he walked outside. And he was directed … He’s a man that makes things out of rocks; tumbles rocks, I meant. Said he went to where they said the cross was drove down, and he just dropped off … knocked off a little piece of rock about like … oh, a inch square, or something; put it in his pocket, and was impressed to bring it home. When he did, something said to him, “Make Brother Branham a pair of cuff links out of that.” So he put it in the acid, and it changed the color from the regular limestone-looking rock to a bloodstone rock. And he made the cuff links. And when he give them to me, he hadn’t noticed it, but right through the middle of both cuff links runs that straight, narrow strip. I have them on tonight, to pray for the sick. See, a—a bloodstone color, like the dripping blood; with the straight, narrow line right through. Just exactly what his prophecy said, “the straight and narrow way”; see, in the prophecy. I showed it to him. Danny, if you’re listening in, you or Brother Le Doux, either one, tonight’s going to be the old-fashioned night when we’re to pray for the sick. I’m glad to walk this straight, narrow way, the way of the Gospel, the way of the Word, with our Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you all. Now, you’re so nice to talk to, I’ll just talk a long time and I’ll have you here too long. Billy said there’s between three and four hundred people to be prayed for, so I’ll just have to hurry up with our message as quick as possible, and then pray for the sick. Now, to the people in Arizona, the next Saturday night, we’re over at (never can think of the name of that town) Yuma, Arizona, at the banquet. So then, in California, we follow right on in Sunday morning, to Los Angeles and the places that’s been predicted to be there. Tonight, I want to take a text out of the Scripture. By the way, I was setting in a cafeteria today, the Morrison’s Cafeteria; Brother Jack, his wife, I and my wife. We went over to Morrison’s Cafeteria to have a little time together, we hadn’t been out, the women had never been together. There was a young fellow walked up to me, his name’s Green, he’s the father of Brother Pearry Green. And he said, “You know, Brother Branham, you was talking about a ‘johnny pin’ the other night.” That’s really a … What is it? Bobby pin. He said, “You were talking about a ‘johnny pin,’” said, “I got you a ‘johnny pin.’” He gave it to me. Now, that’s a “johnny pin,” ladies, that won’t work in the hair. A “johnny pin,” he said—said he’d been using it for years, to hold the pages of his Bible down. So he said, “I’ll give you a genuine ‘johnny pin.’” So, Brother Green, if you’re here somewhere or listening in, that “johnny pin’s” a dandy, just holds it right. Now we want to get into the Scriptures right away. And I want you to turn with me now to Psalms 55, and then also Matthew 3. And my subject tonight was Brother Ernie’s topic: On The Wings Of A Snow-White Dove. Now, I won’t be able to strike all the notes and Scriptures that I got here, because I’ll just kind of skip over a few of them, and because I promised the message. The Lord willing, for Yuma next Saturday night, I want to preach on: The Conditions For The Rapture, if the Lord willing. In Psalms 53 … I beg your pardon, Psalms 55. Give ear … (Pardon? 55, yes, sir.) Give ear to my prayer, O God; … hide not thyself from my supplication. Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. My heart is sore pained within me: and the terror of death are fallen upon me. Fearless and trembling comings are come upon me, the horror has overwhelmed me. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah. (Selah means “Amen.”) David, a lover of the wilderness, when he got distressed and the people wouldn’t believe him, and the enemies had come upon him, he said, “If I had the wings of a dove, I would fly out into the wilderness and there remain.” How many times have I thought that same thing! If I could take my rifle off of the wall, my camp bag, go out in the wilderness and never return again. I’ve asked the Lord if I can live to see the day … I don’t never want a funeral service, I said, “If I can just go out in the woods somewhere, set old ‘Blondie’ against the tree, … ” That’s my rifle, excuse me, I—I—I say that on account of my wife setting there. You know, that rifle, a Brother here gave me years ago, I killed fifty-five head of game with it, without missing a shot, some of them seven to eight hundred yards. I call it “Blondie” because my wife’s a brunette, so she said I think more of the rifle than I do her. But … So, I—I’d like to set it against a tree, and say, “Lord, let Joseph find it someday.” I like to take the wings of a dove and fly away. But just like one time up in the mountains and watching an eagle, and seeing him fly away (you know my story of it), I said, “It’s good to be here, Lord; like Peter said, ‘we could build three tabernacles.’ But down at the foot of the mountain, the sick and the afflicted are waiting, the lost and dying are waiting.” So let us do what we can while it’s day, and someday there’ll be a … the wings of a white Eagle will come down, He’ll bear us away. Now in Matthew 3:16, I’d like to read 16 and 17. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went straightway up out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. (In other words, “in whom I’m pleased to dwell in.”) Now we want to speak a few minutes on this bird. A dove has always been one of my favorite birds. And thinking of a dove, a dove is really … and a pigeon is the same bird. A pigeon is a domestic dove. They’re both the same family. I’ve looked it up and it is the same family. A pigeon and a dove, they’re both of the same family. The habits of these birds are outstanding. I preached here, some few years ago, in a tent meeting out here with Brother Moore, on: The Lamb And The Dove. I guess you all remember that; and how that the dove is the most cleanest bird that we have, and the lamb is the most meekest animal that we have. They’re both sacrificial bird and beast. How beautiful it’s typed here as Jesus being the Lamb, and God being the Dove. And the dove would not have settled on a wolf, his nature’s not right. It couldn’t have settled on a dog, his nature’s not right. It had to be on a lamb; the two natures had to be the same. And that’s the way we have to be, our natures has to change from the roaring sinner to the meekness of a lamb. And did you notice the Dove led the Lamb? And notice, the Lamb forfeit everything He had to the Dove. And look where the Dove led Him: to crucifixion for the sins of us all. Now, the Dove of … God wanted to represent His Son, He was represented by the most cleanest and meekest animal on the earth, a earthbound creature; but when God represented Himself in the heavens, was by the meekest and most cleanest bird there is in the heavens, a dove. Now, doves vary, there’s many different variations of them. Usually our turtledove is kind of a gray-looking bird. And then there’s a mourning dove, and then there’s the evening dove. There’s also called the sonora dove that we have at home, he’s a little, gray fellow; little, bitty fellow with red stripes on his wings. There’s many different kinds of doves, and they vary in colors. So is there same thing in the pigeons. Now, the dove is a very odd constructed dove, because his habit’s that he cannot eat anything that’s unclean; he just couldn’t do it, because he’s not built for it. Now, I’ve always talked about the dove being the symbol of God, and the crow being the symbol of the hypocrite. A crow can set out on an old dead carcass and eat, all day long, and fly right out in the field and eat wheat with the dove. But the dove can eat wheat all right, but it can’t eat the dead carcass. See? He just can’t do it, he can’t stomach it. And I wondered why he couldn’t do it; they’re both fowls, both birds. But why? It’s the structure of them. That’s the way it is with a genuine Christian. A … just a denominational Christian can just take anything, but a genuine, borned-again Christian cannot take the things of the world. He’s constructed different. I found out that the dove don’t have any gall. There’s no gall in a dove because he has no need of it. So that’s the way it is with a Christian, he doesn’t need any bitterness, see, ’cause he only can eat the Food of God. And it doesn’t take bitterness to dissolve that; takes love, see, so he … to dissolve the food. Bitterness: “Oh,” they say, “well … ” they difference with It. But love always receives It, the Word of God. Now, he has no gall, so therefore he could not … it’s just against him to eat anything bad. And if he would, it would kill him. But there’s no danger, he isn’t going to eat it (uh-huh), because he has no appetite for it. And that’s the way with a real Christian. Did you know a real Christian doesn’t have even any sin at all imputed to him? David said, “Blessed is the man who God will not impute sin to.” When you’re washed in the Blood of the Lamb (not by make-belief, but really the—the Blood of the Lamb), God does not impute to you anything that’s done, because you’re under the Blood and He doesn’t see it. There’s a Blood sacrifice; the only thing He can see you in, is the way He saw you before the foundation of the world when He put your name in the Lamb’s Book of Life. That’s all He can look at, because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done, you’re washed in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore there’s no gall in you, there’s no unclean habit in you, because that the Blood of the Lamb has did this; and God cannot impute sin to you after you’ve got a sin-offering laying there waiting for you. “Well,” you say, “that gives me plenty of room then, Brother Branham, I can do what I want to.” I always do; always. But when a man can really see what Jesus done for him, and turn around and do something contrary to Him, it shows he never received Christ. I got a little wife setting back there. She’s ten years younger than me, and is gray as I am. The reason is because she’s stood between me and the—and the outside world. If I was going overseas, and I’d … Wouldn’t this be some sort of a family to live in, if I’d gather my family around me and I’d say: “Looky here, Mrs. Branham, you want to realize that you’re Mrs. William Branham. Thou shalt not have any other husbands while I’m gone. Don’t you make eyes at any other man,” and all these things. “Don’t you flirt at all. If you do, when I come back I’m going to divorce you.” And she’d turn around and say, “Now, my good man, I want to tell you something also. Thou shalt not take out any other woman while you’re gone. Thou shalt not do this and that. If you do, just consider yourself divorced when you come home.” Now, wouldn’t that be a loving family? See? No! If I really love her … Though I believe if I did make a mistake and slip and do something wrong, I believe she’d forgive me for it because she loves me. And if she did, I believe I’d forgive her for it; certainly, because I love her. But if I love her like that, as long as I love her like that she has no worry. Though she would forgive me, I wouldn’t hurt her for nothing. I—I—I’d feel the guiltiest guy in the world, I couldn’t wait for the minute I’d tell her about what I done, because I love her. Well, that’s … If I love her with phileo love like that, how much greater would my agapao love be to Jesus Christ? Though I might smoke a cigarette, I never in my life; but though I would, He might forgive me for it, I believe He would. If I took a drink, I never in my life, but I believe He’d forgive me for it. And I love Him too much, (God, help me) I don’t want to do anything like that, see, because I love Him. That stuff is gone from me, because when He changed me from a crow to a dove it made a difference, my appetite and things left me; then sin is not imputed to me because I don’t aim to do it, it’s not in me to do it. Now another great thing about this dove. He’s a strange bird. Did you ever see all the birds … One of my favorite birds is a robin. Now, you boys quit shooting at my robins, see, ’cause I don’t want you doing that. My robin, you know how he got his red breast? You know, one day there was a Man dying on the cross, nobody would help Him, God had forsaken the Man, and He was dying. His hands had nails in them, His feet and His side bleeding, crown on His head and thorns, blood running over His face. And there was a little bird passed by, a little, brown bird. And he looked at that, was … thought it was the most pitiful sight he ever saw. And he knowed he was just a little bird, but he looked at them great big, ol’ cruel Roman nails drove in His hand, and he flew in with his little beak and tried to pull them loose. He got his breast all bathed with blood, since then it’s been red. I want my breast shielded with His Blood, too, defending It when I come to meet Him. I love a little robin. But, you know, a little robin has to take a bath; but, you know, a dove don’t have to; no. He’s got some kind of oil on the inside of him that oils him and keeps him clean from the inside out. You know that? The dove has! The dove oils himself. Did you ever pick up one, smell that odor on him, a pigeon or something? That’s oil that’s produced from the inside of him. His body makes up a oil gland that keeps his feathers always clean on the outside because he’s clean from inside out. That’s right. He’s a marvelous little bird. Now, I know you can hunt them here, I think, in Louisiana. Don’t do that! Oh, I couldn’t do it. I guess if I was hungry, it’d be all right, but I—I just couldn’t pull the trigger on one if I had to. There’s … A dove has a great strange thing in our family. One day when my grandmother … She come from up here in Kentucky, off the Cherokee reservation. She was dying, a little woman, and she was … They had … I think they call it scrofula or something, she was dying. And grandfather knelt down by the side of the bed; while Mama, Aunt Birtie, Aunt Howlie, all of them knelt around the bed; Uncle Charlie, (little bitty, four-year-old boy) the baby; Mama, the oldest, being about twelve years old. And she had combed her black hair out on the bed, and she started singing, “Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in Thee,” when she was dying. Grandpa, at that time, wasn’t a Christian. I baptized him at eighty-seven years old, in the Name of Jesus Christ, at the foot of the river there where the Angel of the Lord appeared. But while she was singing this song, with her feeble little hands up in the air, a dove flew in the door; come around, set down on the top of the bed, started cooing. God took her soul. I went over to London, England with Brother Jack and with Brother Gordon Lindsay, and there had been a woman by the name of Florence Nightingale (claims to be, I think, a great-granddaughter or something of the late Florence Nightingale) that wrote me many letters. She was down in South Africa, dying with a cancer. And she had a picture; you seen it in the book. I never seen a mortal like that in my life. Brother Jack, I believe, was with me that day. We went into a minister’s house, at the rectory, just behind the church where they had brought her. While we were yet out on the … where the plane come down, they paged us, and she was in a ambulance there then; had been flown up from—from down in South Africa, knowing that I was coming to England at that time. The minister took her to the rectory, so we went back there to pray for her. I’ve seen lots of sick people, but her little arms didn’t look over a inch across, her—her skull where it laces together, you could see it. And she … her limbs way up here around her hips wasn’t over that, about two inches across, just the bone. And she couldn’t raise her hands, she was too weak to raise her hands. And she was trying to say something, and I couldn’t understand her. And when I finally got to hear, I believe through a nurse, she said, “Brother Branham, pray that God will let me die.” She couldn’t … didn’t want to live. And I noticed, and tears was running off of the side of them bone on her face. Where she got enough moisture about her to cry, I don’t know; for her veins was collapsed, and she was in a terrible condition. Coming to pray for the sick, I couldn’t pray for her to die. But she just looked like couldn’t die, she just lingered on. I knelt down with your pastor, in the room to pray. And when I knelt down to pray, a little dove flew up by the window; begin cooing. When I finished praying, I thought it was a pet dove there somewhere. Foggy outside, how England is, the British Isles there. And this little dove quit cooing, and flew away. I walked over and laid hands upon her and called the Name of the Lord. And the woman is a great big, strong healthy woman today, on the wings of a Dove. He keeps hisself clean from the inside. A Christian does that too, he cleans from the inside. That keeps the malice … He don’t need any gall to digest anything, because he doesn’t eat it. See? He’s clean from the inside out. Now, we notice that this bird … Many things I’ve got written down here, but the clock keeps moving around. This bird was also used in the Old Testament for sacrifice, for an atonement and for cleansing. Let’s just refer here to one in Genesis 15:9. Let’s think of this verse just for a moment. Now, Abraham was … asked God here, how would He do this. And God is making His Word back to Abraham, and He does it in a strange way. Begin with about the … Let’s begin at the lst verse. Don’t like to hurry this. After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abraham in a vision, … See, Abraham was a prophet, so he saw visions.  … Fear not, Abraham: I am thy shield, and … exceeding reward. (Jehovah-Manesses, see.) And Abraham said, Lo- … said, Lord GOD … (Notice, capital L, “Lord GOD.” Elohim! See?) … Lord GOD, … (in the vision) … what will thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold, to me thou has given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is my heir. And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; … Done made him a promise, you know. Not … See, right then Abraham would have failed, but the promise is unconditional; the covenant, unconditional.  … but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. (And he’s a hundred years old now.) And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards the heavens, and tell the stars, if thou are able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. (A man without a child, and now a hundred years old.) And he believed in the LORD; and it was counted unto him for righteousness. And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur, out of the Chaldeans, to give thee the land to inherit it. And he said unto Him, Lo- … Lord … or Lord … whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? Now listen to this. And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, … (watch the threes now, “three years old”) … and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. (Both the same people, both the same thing. See, it was used in a sacrifice that he was foreshowing Jesus.) The covenant was made … You know, how he cleave them apart, and how that this … Or the old times, when they took … made a covenant, they would take and write the—the agreement up. And kill an animal, stand in between it; tear the covenant in two, one person took one part … Like the Chinese laundry used to do. The Chinaman here, he couldn’t write English, so he wrote on there and tore a piece of paper and handed you a part. And you—you remember the Chinese laundries when they used to do that. And you … their—their two ends had to compare, to get your clothes. See, you couldn’t fool him, ’cause he had the other end of it. You might re-copy your name, but you can’t retear that paper. See? So, he had … it had to be the same piece of paper. So that’s the way they done it in the Oriental days, long … or long ago in the Eastern days. They’d kill an animal, stand in between it, tear the piece of goatskin apart, one took one … And when the covenant was confirmed, they brought the pieces together and they had to dovetail just exactly. Now, what God is showing him here is this, on these sacrifices, is speaking of Christ; that how God took Jesus to the Calvary and tore Him apart, and received the body up into Heaven and sent the Spirit down upon us, that the same Spirit was on Him has to be on you to dovetail with the Body, to be the Bride at the end time. See? See? That’s right. See? Won’t be a denomination, now. It’ll be the Word, what He was. See? But like that Word has to come to Word, like cell in a human being. You know, when your—your body’s being built, it isn’t one cell of a human, next of a dog, and next of a pig. Oh, no, no. It’s all human cell. That’s the way the Body of Christ is, all the Word of God. Not just part of It, some tradition added to It; no, It’s all the Body of Christ. Now, we find here that he used both a turtledove and a young pigeon, because they are the selfsame family. Now, you always … So notice (I just refer to a couple of these Scriptures) Leviticus 12, and the 6th verse. We find here that the order of a woman being purified; if the woman had a baby, she had to wait. If it was a boy, she had to wait for thirty-three days before she could enter the congregation with the doves, for purification. If she had a girl, she had to wait ninety-six days before she could enter the congregation. Now we find here, the 6th verse. And when the days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: See, she can’t come in yet because her days isn’t finished yet, but she can give this to the—the priest at the door, for her offering. See, either a turtledove or a young pigeon. They’re both the same family. Now it—now it was used for atonements, and in the atonement for sin, one dove. Or of leprosy, which is a type of sin, you brought two doves: one’s head was taken off, turned upside down and bled on the other one; and then the other dove was set free. And when the dove flew, he bathed the ground with his blood of his mate, and the blood cried out to God, “Holy! Holy! Holy is the Lord God!” Can’t you see the dying Mate, Jesus Christ? Was killed and sprinkled upon us, that we should go free, crying out “Holy! Holy! Holy! unto the Lord.” What beautiful types. Wished I had some voice. Now type the great Holy Spirit as we just read in Revelation 3:16; used of God for signs, this dove was. Noah was given a sign, as the brother just sang about it. God was displeased, and there was nothing going to stay His wrath, for He said, “The day you eat thereof, that day you die.” And Noah had found grace with God and had built an ark according to the constructions … the instructions, rather, that He had given him. And he had been floated up. I can imagine his … what happened in them days when they said, “This old man up on the hill, an old fanatic, building an ark, saying ‘it’s going to rain,’ and it never has rained.” But it … Noah said, “It’s going to rain, anyhow.” And then I know the day that he went in, I think what … can’t think of what day it was, I believe the seventeenth day of May. Noah entered into the ark, and God shut the door. And the clouds begin to come, the rains begin to fall, the sewers begin to fill up, the fountains of the deep broke up, the springs all belched up their water. Finally people got into the houses, climbed up. The old ark set right there just the same. After while when enough begin to get around her, she begin to rise up higher and higher. The people knocked at the doors and screamed, but it did no—no good, Noah could not open the door. God closed it, God’s the only One can open it. So is it at our Ark, Jesus Christ; God opened the door for us on Calvary, He’ll close it just as sure as He opened it. And it floated, and on and on, maybe a mile’s deep over the top of the earth when this earth was tumbling out from the way … from the—the … its regular orbit. And around and around it went, and chunks, and trees, and above the mountains and so forth, pitching for forty days and nights. And when the winds begin to cease … God’s wrath is horrible. His love is pure and Divine; and His wrath is just as Divine—just as Divine as His love is, because, He must pass judgment because He is a judge. He’s a law-giver, and law without penalty is not law. So there must be a penalty to law. And you transgress God’s laws, that’s when you pay the penalty. Now we notice that after Noah floating up there, no doubt seasick from all that roaring and popping, and the wrath of God mashing and crushing, and screams and so forth. Then it begin to quieten down, nothing happened. Days passed, nothing happened. Perhaps the food supply for the animals and so forth running low, nothing happened. So he thought, “Wonder … I can’t see out.” The ark was so constructed (when you were once in it), there was only one window in it, and it was right in the top. You couldn’t look sideways, you couldn’t look no way but straight up. And that’s the way the Ark, Jesus Christ, is. You can’t look at the next fellow, you can’t look at nothing but Christ when you’re in the Ark because there’s only one door, and He is that Door we talked about this morning. You have to keep looking up, “For he that will put his hand to the plow and even turn to look back, is not worthy of the plowing.” Now, as in this ark … And he could see light, and perhaps sunlight, but he wondered where he was. The ark was still floating, he could hear the waves against the sides, but he knew that there’d been many days, surely the water was receding by that time. So he went and got an untrusted bird, treacherous, and he tried him, and he sent him out. He was a crow, and that crow never did return, because he found pleasure out there, outside the ark of God. He flew from one old dead body to another, eating the carcasses and the a-carrion that was floating on the water; and he was perfectly satisfied. So after several days he tried again, for he knowed … He didn’t want to step out in the wrath of God. So he turned a dove loose. And this dove was of a different nature than the … It was not a vulture, neither is it a scavenger, it can only eat the clean pure things. And it was so satisfied because it couldn’t find nothing else to put the soles of his feet on, it returned back to the ark. Noah said, “Well, the flood’s still on.” Then he waited several other days, and he sent out again; like his prayer, “O God, has Your wrath been appeased? Is—is—is Your wrath over, Lord? Is it all done?” And he said, “Now, if I send her out this time, she may stay out there if the floods are down, she may stay.” But he sent her out by prayer, and then when she went out there directed by God, she picked off a olive leaf off of a tree, and flew back and pecked on the window again. God used a dove for a sign. She come back saying that “the flood is over,” and then God opened the door, and they went out. That’s Genesis 8:8. Also used in Matthew 3:16, again when God’s wrath was on the earth. And there was no way, the darkest of night, midnight, the churches had got things in such a twist till there was no way to get out of it. And there was false teachers, all kinds of things coming up, all kinds of professions coming up, but God used a dove again. It pleased Him, His Son Jesus had pleased Him so well, that He identified Him. Now, they couldn’t believe that this baby that was born down there in that stable in a manger of hay … before His father and mother, supposingly to be, was married. They couldn’t imagine God using anything like that. So He had to be identified to the world; and that day down on the river, when He walked down to prove Hisself God’s Masterpiece (that I talked about this morning) … When He was obedient to walk into the water … Now, if you notice there, there’s a great lesson. John was the greatest man on earth, at the time. Jesus said, “There never was a man borned of a woman as great as he,” to that time. And he was a prophet. You believe that? Now, remember, if the Word of God will come to anything in the land, it’ll be a prophet. That’s always God’s way. Do you believe that Jesus was the Word manifested in flesh? So there’s only one way He can come to be introduced; not by the priests. He didn’t go up and say, “Caiaphas, will you introduce Me?” If He did, He made the same mistake that David did in our lesson the other day; see, if He went up to the church, and said, “Will you introduce Me?” Just notice when He was borned, even. When He was borned, He was borned in the shadow of the church. And they was probably rang the bells and everything, but it was shepherds that recognized Him, and Magi. See? And here He is now, on … ready for His ministry. And if He is the Word … According to God’s great plan, the Word can only … “The Lord God does nothing until He first reveals It to His servants the prophets.” That’s always His pattern, has to be; when the Seals were opened, when anything else. Any major event taking place in the earth, God reveals it to His prophets. And John was the prophet, for he was prophesying “He’d come.” Then down off the side of a hill one day … when a discussion was going on, a bunch of priests standing around. And they said, “Do you mean to tell me that you call yourself a ‘prophet,’ and stand over there in that mud?” (not in a church, because they wouldn’t have him) “Stand over that mud, and tell me that the hour’s coming when the great Jehovah Who ordained these sacrifices, when great Jehovah Who built this temple, Who came into it as a Pillar of Fire, ‘the day will come when that daily sacrifice will be taken away’?” He said, “There will come a Man, and He’s among you now (somewhere out there), and He will take away the sin.” The priest was discussing it with him. John looked up! Now, what is he? The prophet! And here is the Word, there comes the Word coming right straight to the prophet, right to the water. John said, “Behold, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. There He is, that’s Him.” Jesus never spoke a word, walked right out into the water. And I can see there, standing in that water (think of a drama), two of the greatest that ever struck the earth: God the Word, and His prophet. Notice, the Word come to the prophet in this dispensation of grace, in the water (uh-huh). I thought you’d catch it (uh-huh). In the water! The first revelation of the Word was in the water. Now you see where the Bride started, the Evening-light Message? In the water! The Word, true Word not mixed up with creeds, but come to the prophet in the water, by the water. Notice! Could you imagine the eyes of the Word and the eyes of the prophet meeting in the water? Oh, that’s too much for me. There stood the prophet, there stood the Word, looking in each others’ eyes. And the prophet said, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, why comest Thou unto me?” And the Word said … It has to be true. Now let me give a drama here: “John, you’re a prophet, you know the Word.” See? “You recognize Me, you know Who I am.” “I have need to be baptized of Thee,” John said. Jesus said, “Suffer that to be so. That’s exactly right, you do have need to be baptized of Me. But remember, John, being a prophet, it is behooving to us, or becoming to us (as the Word and the prophet), that we fulfill every Word. Uh-huh. For, John,” (here’s the revelation now) “John, you know Who I am, I am the Sacrifice. And according to the Word of God, the sacrifice had to be washed before it was presented for sacrifice.” Is that right? The Word … “The lamb was washed and then presented for sacrifice, and I am that Lamb. And I must be washed before I can be presented to the world for a sacrifice. Suffer it to be so, John, for thus it is becoming to us as the Word and the prophet together.” Well, there can’t be a mistake. Now, every one of these things … Now, see, if it wasn’t that very setup, John would’ve been like any of the rest of us; so they say, “Yeah, I—I know who You are, Lord.” “Well,” He said, “wait a minute, I’m the Word. Uh-huh. ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word.’ Eve left off one uh-huh, but you got to take every Word. And I am that Sacrifice, and I must be washed before I’m presented. But what you said, John, is true.” John being a prophet, knowing the Word had to be fulfilled, he suffered that and baptized Him. And when He was raised up out of the water, there come the Message from Heaven on the wings of a Dove, “This is My beloved Son.” He sent the redemption Message of grace on the wings of a Dove, come flying down out of the heavens. “Peace on earth, good will toward men.” The Sacrifice was ready right then; been raised, fed, His ministry was ready, a Word that would redeem the whole world, “It’s over!” The dove is used in the Bible as a symbol of peace, and also it’s used by nations as a symbol of peace. We have nations … Our nation is represented by an eagle. And there’s other birds of other nations, Rome has an eagle, Germany has an eagle; many of them, great birds of the sky. But in all of them, the dove symbolizes peace in all nations. It’s a universal thing. Just like Brother Green said one night, Brother Pearry Green said, “The symbol of surrender is ‘raise your hands.’ Any nation, raise up your hands, it’s surrender.” He said, “When you sing, raise up your hands, you surrender it all.” And the dove is the symbol of peace in every nation. Why is it done? Because of its gentleness, and because of its innocence. That’s the reason it symbols peace. Another thing about the dove, it is a home-loving bird. It loves to stay home. And another thing it is, it’s always loyal to its mate. The dove, male or female, never leave one another. That female finds her mate in mating season. See, that’s complimentary to God’s great creation. That’s the reason He made Eve a by-product. See? If she’d been made like other females, when the time come for her mating time, she’d found her mate; but she could any time. See? And that’s the way, that’s what it is. I just … We don’t want to go into that, because I’ve got it on Marriage And Divorce, and so forth. And how it … But yet she’s honorable and brought that virtue, and you know how I preached on it the other night. All right, notice, she’s got a great responsibility. But the dove is always loyal to his mate. Always! Never leaves her. And may I stop here just for a minute, to say this: a true Bride, female dove, is loyal to her Mate, too. It won’t inject any dogmas, any denominational doctrines, anything of the world. It’ll stay loyal to its Mate, the Word; always loyal. And by this home-loving conduct, by the conduct of its home-loving, it has been successfully used for a carrier pigeon. Because it loves home, you turn it loose anywhere, it’ll always go back home. It’ll go back home. We’d like to stress on that a little while, and you Christians would understand what I mean. It always finds its way back home, so therefore it’s been used for carrier pigeon. It’s used in time of war, used to be; they still use them, carrier pigeons to carry a message. So you see then, that makes the dove, both by God and man, a messenger; a dove is a messenger. It was a messenger to Noah, to tell Noah that “there’s peace again.” It was used by God to vindicate that this was His Son, “the Sacrifice to bring peace upon the earth and goodwill to men.” It was used as a messenger. Right here I have a little story in my mind, I read one time out of a book. Now, I don’t want to say this is sure, it may be in The Decline of the First World War. I’m not positive of that now; if you miss seeing it, then I’m wrong. I either read it in a book … it’s been many years ago. But it was certainly a—a … really a—a dramatic thing that happened. The American soldiers was pinned down by German machine-gun fire, and they were in kind of a pit. You soldiers, I guess, understand how they were on a reconnaissance somewhere. And they was pinned down, and they had just a little bit of ammunition left. And the Germans was moving in great units, moving in everywhere. And they knowed that unless they’d get some reinforcement, some help, that they would soon all die; (they had to) the Germans coming right down off the mountain, looking right down their neck, going right into them like that. And one of them happened to remember that he had a little mascot, a little pigeon. So he knew that this pigeon, if it could get out of there, would carry the message to the main headquarters to where they’d been stationed. And so they set down and wrote on a note, “We are pinned down in a certain position at a certain area. We’re out of ammunition, in a few hours we’ll have to surrender or either we’ll be massacred.” And they pinned this, or tied it on the—the foot of this little dove and turned him loose. Now, he’s a home-loving bird, so he … what does he do? He takes back home for his … meet, find his mate. She was worried about him, he’d have to come back home. And as he went up, the Germans seen what had happened. So the thing they done, they started shooting at the dove. And one of them hit him with a .30 caliber machine gun, or bullet, it broke his leg. Another one tore a big hunk out of his back. His chest was bruised all the way across. One of his wings was crippled, the end shot off of it, and he flew sideways. But he kept climbing, and finally he made it. Crippled, wounded, broken, bruised, but he fell in the camp with the message. That was a great dove. But, oh, brother, Isaiah 53 tells us of One, came down from Home and all that was good. And he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquity: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we were healed. Sickness, superstition, and devils had us pinned down, there was no way out, the church had gone wrong, they had went off on denominational things (and the Pharisees, Sadducees, and washing of pots and pans), and the Word of God become of no effect. But this little Dove came down, and there’s only one thing could take place: there had to be a redeemer. But being wounded, broken, beaten, torn, but He knowed His way back Home. So from Calvary’s cross where they bruised Him, mashed Him, tore Him, like a bunch of wolves upon Him, He made His flight from Calvary and He landed in Heaven’s doors, saying, “It’s finished! It’s finished! They are free! Sickness can be healed now! Sinners can be saved! The captive can be set free!” Though He was bruised and wounded, that great battle there when even everything against Him … Even the poet cried out: Mid rendering rocks and darkening skies, My Saviour bowed His head and died; But the opening veil revealed the way To Heaven’s joy and endless day. I’ve been a neurotic all my life. As a little boy there was something struck me, that scare me, about every seven years it would happen to me. Brother Jack remembers when I first started, come off the field for a year; something just happened. I remember the day that Juanita Hemphill … I think her name’s Juanita Kelly now, she married Brother Kelly after the death of her husband. Anna Jeanne, I’ve got their pictures and things, they were such … And her … And them two girls and Sister Moore had a—a little trio. They sang that song that I never forget: Looking Beyond The Sunset. Brother Jack, you remember, I guess, coming up from Florida. What fine little girls. And I remember that morning a little Pentecostal group from up here in northern part of the country, in Michigan somewhere, those girls stood out there when Brother Hooper … I seen him here the other night, I … he may not be here now, Brother Ed Hooper. Are you here, Brother Ed? I don’t think he … He set here the other night. None … Many of you know him. He and I, and Brother Hooley, we was leaving. And those girls standing there on the corner singing that, gave us, each one, a yellow rose that they took out of their hair. (That’s where that maniac had been healed down there, great things had took place.) Coming up the road just as happy as I could be, all of a sudden it struck me; a year later ’fore I entered the field again, just killed me. Since a little boy, I always said I didn’t know what a vision was. A little boy, I always said, “If I—if I’d only fall in one of those trance, and see that, I’d get well.” That time … I always wanted to go to Mayo’s to find out what was wrong. The doctors there … My stomach gets sour; and oh, my! Brother Jack’s helped me around the house. I walk right around the house; and just a hot greasy water like, flying out of my mouth. And walk to the pulpit, and pray for people that was twice that bad, and be healed. I’ve had them lay my hands on a man with a cancer on his face, and the cancer left his face, standing there; and I was so sick I couldn’t stand up. And you don’t know what I’ve suffered; just mental oppression. Every seven years it’s come, all my life. That’s where I’m at now, seven eights. So I was—I was so distressed; I cried, I begged, I pleaded. And I remember when I finally thought I had enough money to go to Mayo’s for an examination; they said, “They’ll find what your trouble is.” Wife and I, and Becky back there … Sarah was a little, bitty fellow. I just entered my healing ministry. And we took off to Mayo’s. I went through the clinic. And the night before I’d find … had my finals the next morning, I just woke up and was setting there on the bed looking around. And I looked out in front of me, and there was a little boy, looked just like me, about seven years old; and looked at it, and it was me. And he was standing by an old snag tree. And on that tree … Any of you squirrel hunters know you can rub a stick up and down on a tree like that, and it’ll scare a squirrel and run him out if he’s in the hollow. And I was seeing there where that squirrel had been, and I thought, “What kind of squirrel is that?” and I rubbed it. And when I did, I looked over and it was me then about thirty-eight years old, the little boy was gone. So I rubbed that limb, and out of the hollow log, pole, come a little squirrel about that long, dark, almost black, and looked like little currents flying from him; little bitty beady eyes, the wickedest looking thing that I ever seen, looked like a weasel more than a squirrel. And he looked right at me. And I opened my mouth to say, “Well … ” And when I did, he … Before you could’ve batted your eye, he flew right into my mouth, went down into my stomach, and just tearing me to pieces. And as I come out of the vision, with my hands up, looking, I went screaming, “O God, have mercy! It’s killing me!” I heard a Voice way down in the room, say, “Remember, it’s only six inches long.” How many’s heard that story? I’ve told you that many times, the people around the tabernacle. Well, on and on it went, suffering just the same. Mayo Brothers, the next day, examined me. Said, “Your father was an Irishman, he drank. Your mother being a half Indian, that makes you almost a half-breed. So you’ll be … you’re—you’re—you’re just such a nervous wreck until you’ll never be out of it.” Said, “Otherwise, you’re healthy. But that, that’s something in the soul that man cannot control.” Said, “You will … ” Said, “When a man dies, can’t hold a autopsy, ’cause his soul’s gone.” He said, “Well, you’ll never get over it.” And that guy said, my old doctor, said, “My father had it, he died at about eighty-five, ninety years old,” somewhere along there, he said. And said, “A month or two before he died, I examined him; had it all of his life, he’d get them” said, “spells.” “Some people,” said, “they get it, they’re high tempered”; said, “that’s the kind that’ll kill you.” He said, “The other kind, like women in menopause, they cry. You got the kind that’s kind of a weary feeling.” Said, “The old-timers used to call it ‘had the blues,’ it wouldn’t leave them.” Said, “When that hits you, your stomach sours; you’re just upset.” I said, “But, sir, I don’t do nothing.” I said, “I’m happy.” Said, “That’s right. That’s just out of the human grab bag.” Said, “You’ll always have it.” Oh, what a discouraging thing! But the words, to think it, “Remember, it’s only six inches long,” that’s hung with me, as my dear wife back there can tell you. Year after year, I’ve thought of that. And then, going overseas this last time, I was … before. Well, I was back home, and I was on a squirrel-hunting trip. I jumped out of the car with Brother Banks Wood, who’s listening in tonight, and I started to run up the hill, and looked like my heart would jump out of me. And I asked Dr. Sam Adair, I said, “What does that?” He said, “Next time you have it, get a cardiogram.” Said, “All right.” So it happened again in the—the next year, and went and took the cardiogram. He said, “Nothing wrong with your heart,” said, “you’re just nervous.” Started coming on then. Well, another doctor said to me, a good friend of mine, said, “That’s your heart, boy,” said “you better be careful.” That’s the year I called Brother Moore and he got somebody to preach in my stead, when I went on that ram hunt with Brother Fred. I’d go up over mountains just like I did when I was sixteen years old, mile after mile, running; never bothered me a bit. See? I come back and told Sam. He said, “Well, there’s something wrong, you better be careful.” Then I saw a vision of an old doctor standing with those … old-fashioned doctor with stethoscopes over his arm. He said … He was standing in front of me one day, he said, “Don’t let them tell you ‘that’s your heart,’ that’s your stomach.” So, I—I thought, “Well, I’ll just take that word, ’cause it was a vision. Come on.” I started to Africa; get some shots. I had to take a bunch of shots before going to Africa, that’s the law. So, when I was getting these shots, he said, “Why, I can’t find one thing wrong with you.” Said, “Your hemoglobin, your blood’s ninety-six, it’s ninety-six.” Said, “If you was sixteen years old, it wouldn’t be any—it wouldn’t be any better.” And said, “Hard enough to beat you a hundred years. Lungs, everything,” said, “you’re all right; no sugar, nothing.” I said, “Thank you.” So I got a physical test, and—and to take my—my health certificate to the board. So, he said, “You know anything about it?” I said, “Nothing but persistent souring in the stomach all the time.” He said, “Well, I’ll tell you.” He said … I said, “Oh, I’ve been examined. I’ve been to Mayo Brothers, and everywhere.” He said, “But wait a minute.” He said, “Sometimes a ulcer is so little till that barium meal won’t show it; and sometimes it’s too big to show it, because an x-ray is only a shadow. And a little bitty ulcer, you can’t see it, it won’t enough stick. Whole lot of little bitty ulcers could do that.” He said, “I know an old doctor up here that’s found an instrument, they got it now; they can put you to sleep with a little sodium pentothal, put a tube in your throat, and they just actually look down in your stomach and see what’s wrong.” Said, “He … ” Said, “He’s your type of people, he’s a Christian.” Said, “Why don’t you go see him.” I took his name: Dr. Van Ravensworth. So, when I come back, I went up to see the old doctor. Oh, he’s a fine old man from Dutch East Indies, out of a big line of missionaries. And he had heard of me and read my book, and oh, he just shook my hand, he said, “Brother Branham, I’d be glad to do that for you.” He said, “Tell you what to do; next week you run over at the hospital over here,” and said, “and call me up before you go.” And said, “I have to give you a little shot of pentothal.” And said, “Then when I do,” said, “it puts you to sleep for five minutes.” My little girl had just took it to have a tooth pulled, and Brother Norman’s little girl. “A five minute sleep,” I thought, “that won’t bother me.” So, I thought I’d be satisfied then, to look at it. And then the next morning, I raised up in the bed and looked around, I looked over in the twin bed; my wife over there, she hadn’t woke up yet. And I was looking out the window towards the great Catalina Mountains there where I live, and I looked up there where the Angel of the Lord put that Sword in my hand, where the seven Angels that you see in the picture appeared, great things taken place. And I looked, and as I looked, there I was standing by that tree again, right where that squirrel was. I looked up there, I thought, “That’s that squirrel’s den.” And I thought, “Wonder if he’s still up there?” in the vision. I raked the side of the tree, out he come. And before I could even bat my eye … He was the oddest looking squirrel I ever seen; now, you’ll have to know my ministry to know these symbols and things. He jumped at me but he missed me; he missed my mouth, hit on my chest and fell off. And as soon as he did, I heard Something said, “Go to the Catalina Mountains.” So I turned around, I said, “Meda, are you awake, Honey?” And I woke her up. She said, “What’s the matter?” About five o’clock in the morning. I said, “I was looking out here, and I saw that squirrel again, Honey.” “What squirrel?” I said, “The one I seen up there at Mayo’s.” I said, “You know what? He missed my mouth this time, he never hit me, he went out on my chest.” I said, “Praise be to God! I’ve looked, oh, since a little boy, I have longed to see that happen. If I could ever see that happen, not even … Before I knowed what a vision was, if I could ever see that happen, then I said, ‘I’d be all right. Whatever that told me, that’s what I’d be.’ And for forty years I’ve looked for that, and there it happened.” Before, when I was at Mayo’s, the same time I was up there when they give me that message, and I saw the vision … My ol’ mother’s gone on to Glory now, very odd woman. She had about three or four dreams in her life, and they were always true. She’d tell me, and the … She’d start to tell me, I’d tell … I’d say, “Stop right … Mama, I’ll tell you what the rest of it is.” See? Cause always when you give me a dream to interpret, you don’t always tell me just exactly what it is. Then when I see it over again, I see exactly what you dreamed about, then He tells me what it is. See? You don’t have to tell me what the dream is, He shows me the dream Himself. See? And then I see, I say, “Well, you didn’t tell me this and tell me that.” See? And so the God that can interpret a dream, can show a dream; He can show one, He can interpret it. And so then … Well, wasn’t there something like that in the Bible, said, “If you can … ”? I—I … Just happened to come to me. Daniel, wasn’t it? No, Joseph—Joseph. Well, it’s somewhere in the Bible. I just remembered that, said, “If you can show me … If you can tell me what a … ” Oh, it’s King Nebuchadnezzar, that’s right. Said, “If you can … If you can’t … ” The magicians said, “Tell me the dream.” He said, “It’s gone from me.” That’s right, that, I remember that; just thought of it then. Now notice. And Mama, she said, “Billy,” when I come back, she said, “come here, son, and set down.” She said, “I had a strange dream. I dreamed that I seen you a-laying sick, just about to die, with your stomach as usual.” How many diets has she cooked me! And she said, “You were building a house upon a hill.” And said, “I seen six white doves come down from heaven, cooing, in a letter ‘S’ and they set upon your chest. And you was looking, and the one in front was trying to tell you something.” Said, “They was real glossy, white, doves. And they took their little heads and put against your cheek, and going, ‘coo, coo, coo.’” And said, “I couldn’t understand it.” Said, “They just kept going, ‘coo, coo, coo.’” I said, “Oh, I see it, praise the Lord!” And said, “They formed their letter ‘S’ again and went back up into the skies, going ‘coo, coo, coo, coo,’ going back home.” Well, the little animal that I saw was six inches long. The string of doves that Mom saw was six, six is incomplete. I knew that someday I’d see that seventh one. That was man, suffering; so on and on it went. That morning, I got up after seeing this vision; I obeyed the Lord. I took my little boy, Joseph, to school. He’s listening to me now, in Tucson. I took him to school, and told Meda I didn’t know when I’d be back. And I took off up into Catalina, up into the—the foothills, and—and went up into the place where the Angel of the Lord put the Sword in my hand. Real early; and started climbing up the mountain. Well, instead of going up in the peaks this a-way (which there’s a lot snakes, scorpions, you know how Arizona is), I turned to my right; Something said, “Turn to your right.” I went way into the peaks; I went around, and I was going around those great huge rocks, many times bigger than this tabernacle, laying up in them tops there where seldom ever a person could get. And along about eleven o’clock, I was going into a little cove, back where some … a little place turned in like this over a little deer trail. And I had my shirt off, my hat in my hand, because I was just lathering with sweat. And so I turned in there, and as I turned into that little cove, I felt the presence of the Lord. I jerked off my hat and looked around. I thought, “He’s here somewhere. I know He’s here.” I thought, “What is it?” I made a few more steps. I said, “Lord, You’re here somewhere.” And I looked laying on the path, and there laid that little squirrel; had jumped at something and missed it, and it hit a bunch of cholla (that’s jumping cactus). It rammed through his head, chest, stomach, and he was dead. That odd-looking little squirrel, he had missed my mouth and hit that cholla. And the Voice of the Lord said, “Your enemy is dead.” I stood there, and I trembled. I took my foot and ma- … Usually crows would’ve eat it up. I killed a snake, couple days later than that, it laid on the road about a half hour. There’s always eagles and crows flying through there, and they’ll pick it up right now. I killed a coral snake, that’s the most dangerous snake we got; laying right beside of me, a few days after that. I started to come back to pick it up to show it, the crows had done got it, the ravens passing over. And that had been laying there ever since I had seen the vision, two days before; I believe it was on Saturday, and I went up there on Monday. So there he was, laying on there dead. I mashed through it with my foot. I went back around, set down again; set there and cried a while, and prayed; looking down over Tucson, miles below me. Turned back around and come back, it still laid there. When I entered that cove the Spirit of God come on me again. I went on around, went down the mountain. Went in and told my wife, I said, “Honey, I don’t know how, but I’m going to get over this.” Dr. Ravensworth, when he give me the examination, he said, “It’s totally impossible for you to be well.” He give me a shot of pentothal that was to last me for five minutes, and I slept ten hours. So that stuff, even an aspirin just knocks me out. So they … He give me a shot, put that tube down my throat. When I come to, and he told me the next morning, he said, “Reverend, I hate to tell you this, but” said “your stomach walls are even so hard, they’re dried up.” I never seen it; he used the name of gastritis, and I went and looked in the dictionary and it said, “something that’s withered away.” And said, “You can’t get over it.” He said, “You’ll always have it.” And I would’ve been a discouraged boy if it hadn’t been for the vision of the Lord. And the next day Something said, “Go back to the mountain.” And that day instead of going one way, I was led to go another way. And I was standing there; and looking, setting in the front of me, and there set that seventh little, white dove, looking right at me. I rubbed my eyes, I said, “Surely, it’s a vision; surely, it is.” I looked, and I said, “Little dove, where do you come from?” Just as pretty and white, could’ve been a pigeon; whatever it was, away in that wilderness. God Almighty, Who raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, Whose servant I am, and His Word laying here, open before me, know that I tell the truth and lie not. There set the dove, setting there looking at me. I walked around, I thought, “Surely, it’s a vision.” I turned my head, I looked back, and there he set there; them little, white wings, just as snowy as he could be; his little, yellow feet; and little, yellow beak; setting there looking at me. He was watching right straight westward. I walked around him like that, I wouldn’t touch him for nothing. I walked on up the trail; looked back, and there he still set watching me. Brother, as a son of Abraham, I consider not what the doctor told me, I’m going to be well, anyhow! The third day I went back, I was climbing up high. And many of you know the vision about the Indian chief riding that little wall to the west. Something attracted me off to a big rock, about noontime, said, “Lay your hands against that and pray.” God in Heaven knows this is true. I laid my hands against the rock and looked up towards Heaven and started praying. I heard a Voice coming out of the top of the rocks there, said, “What are you leaning against, over your heart?” And I raised back like this, my bare shoulders; naked from my waist up, hot. I looked back. And there was wrote in the quartz, in the stone, “White Eagle”; just exactly what the vision said that the next Message would come forth by. I was so excited, I run home; got a camera and come back the next day, and took the picture of it. It was still there, wrote in the rock: “White Eagle.” (Dove leading eagle.) Somehow, I—I know. I’ll tell you before it happens. The doctor’s a good doc- … good doctor, no doubt; I—I think he’s a fine man. But I—I know I’m going to be over it. It’s done! It’s finished, and I’m going to be well! And I was thinking as Ernie sang that song a few moments ago, On The Wings Of A Dove. How is the melody to that? Start it for me, Ernie.  … wings … snow-white dove, (sing it with me) God sent down His pure, sweet love, Was a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. I understand Ernie made two verses of that. I’m going to make you three verses. Noah had drifted On the floods many days, He searched for land, In various ways; Troubles he had some, But not from above, For God gave him His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Was a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Jesus, our Saviour Came to earth one day; He was borned in a stable, In a manger of hay; Though here rejected, But not from above, For God gave us His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Though I have suffered In many a way, I cried for healing Both night and day; But faith wasn’t forgotten By the Father above, He gave me His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Dear God, I thank You for these things, Father. You give Noah the sign, You gave the world the sign, and You gave me a sign. And the next day, seeing that eagle flying, O God, there’s a Message coming forth now, and I pray, God, that You’ll let the Dove lead. Grant it, Lord. It’s led me to a faith I never had before. I know, God, I know it’s going to be all right; so I thank You for it, Father. And, tonight, send down Your Message again, Lord, on the wings of the Dove of the Word. Grant it, dear Heavenly Father. And every one that passes through this platform, tonight, and out yonder in the meetings across the country, may Your great Dove of faith fall into their hearts and give them faith, Lord, for their healing. Remember that God is not a respect of person. He could send the Message to Noah, could send It to John the Baptist, could send It to me, can send It to others. I pray that that Dove will fly into every heart right now, Lord, with Its little, golden beak, and whisper that, “By His stripes … By My wounds and stripes you are healed.” God, grant that our transgressions will be blotted out, our iniquities will be forgiven us, and that our sickness will be healed. It’s in Your hands, Father. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. With your heads bowed just one minute longer. How many here would like to say, if you can and want to say this, “Brother Branham, I’ve been wrong all my life. I’ve wanted to serve God, but tonight I’m ready to surrender. Pray God, that that Dove will fly into my heart tonight. I can feel It flutter His wings as He comes in”? Raise your hands, will you? Here in the visible audience, my, all over the building. Way out into the audiences across the country, way up to Brother Hunt and Brother Coleman, out to Brother Leo and them, down into Tucson, over in the Branham Tabernacle, across the West Coast, raise your hands everywhere: “I want the Dove to fly into my heart tonight. Bring me God’s sweet love on the wings of a snow-white Dove, the Holy Spirit. Bring It to me, tonight, Lord, and drop into my heart the faith that I have need of.” In the Name of Jesus Christ, I pray, God, forgive our sins. The wounded Dove has brought the Message back, O God, “It’s finished!” We believe that. Just give us faith to believe It, we pray. In Jesus’ Name. Amen. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Was a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Where’d that dove come from? I don’t know. He wouldn’t have been out there in that wilderness like that. No, no! No, he wouldn’t have been there. And why was he white? The Heavenly Father knows he was as white as my shirt. There he set there. But it was on the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Oh, don’t you feel real humble? Let’s just shake one anothers’ hands, and sing it. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Let’s raise our hands to Him, and sing it. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Noah had drifted On the floods many day, He searched for land, In various way; Trouble he had some, But not from above, God sent down His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent down His pure, sweet love, Oh, a sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Jesus, our Saviour Came to earth one day; Borned in a stable, In a manger of hay; Though here rejected, But not from above, God gave us His sign On the wings of a dove. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Why, me an old man, suffered all my life, why did He heal me now? I believe I’ll ride this trail again, I got to bring a Message! And I say to my Father, tonight, (as Junior seen in a—a dream the other night of the wings of this Dove, moving in these windows here), Lord, Your servant’s reporting for service. Amen, I’m ready! On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends me His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Let’s believe now that He’s moving in upon the audience. On the wings of a snow-white … (We’re waiting, Lord.) God sends down His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. You that got prayer cards, in this aisle here, step forward over here; stand up, step forward in this aisle here, over this a-way. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Those with prayer cards in this line, step out to your left. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Those … [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] Oh, on the wings of a snow-white dove, God sent me His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Where did the dove come from up there in the wilderness? I’d say this: God seen Abraham needed a ram for a sign, He’s Jehovah-jireh, “the Lord can provide for Himself the sacrifice.” To think of it! The same God, by the same inspiration, by the same kind of people, sent a dove. He’s still God, Jehovah-jireh can provide anything He has need of. Won’t you, just while you’re coming through this prayer line now, ask God to provide for you on the wings of the Dove? The Dove, Spirit of the Holy Ghost, to give you faith in your heart to believe that you’re going to be healed. I’m trying to get them all on their feet, you see. I’m asking now. Brother Brown’s at his place. Brother Jack … What say? [Someone speaks to Brother Branham — Ed.] All right, good. This section here, comes through this a-way first, that’s lined up. The sections back over in here fall right in behind them. These fall right in behind the wing. And you fall right in behind these here, coming right around to be prayed for. Now, I’m sure this is not going to be no fast line, we’re just going to take a little time so we can really pray for each one, far as we can. Now, I cut my message just a little short (and you all caught that, see) so that I could have this prayer line. This is a memorial line in honor of the days when Brother Jack Moore, Brother Young Brown, your wives let you go, and you come over and we went out into California, and all through Arizona (together, through the desert), and prayed for the sick. You know what? There’s people living today that was dying then, and still alive because of that effort. What did it do? It sprung up Divine healings in every church there is in the country, now even Presbyterians and so forth. They … It hushed their mouth, for it taken God to anoint somebody to slay the Goliath, to show that it could be done, then the rest of them took courage (that’s right) and went on. It can be done again, for He still sends His love on the wings of a Dove. Christians, I want you to listen. If I would stand here and try to quote to you of the supernatural things that I’ve seen happen even in the past three years, I’d be here this time next Saturday night, telling you. I don’t even speak of it so much, ’cause it sounds like it’s almost impossible, but I tell you the Truth. It’s exactly the Truth. We’re living under the leadership of the Great Mighty Jehovah, the same One that was with the prophets in the Old Testament, with the Church in the New Testament, He’s here today taking a Bride out of the Gentiles for His Name’s sake. Believe It! Won’t you, people? If you ever did believe It, believe It right now. That’s who … I want you to do it. We don’t know what’ll happen yet tonight. We don’t know what will happen. We’re just waiting under expectation. Please, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, I ask you as His servant. I know when you’re dealing with congregations, you got everything mixed in there. But if you believe me as His servant, if there’s one speck of doubt (or sin is—is “doubt, unbelief”), if there’s one speck of it in your heart, ask Father to take it away right now. See? “Lord … ” And then when you come with genuine faith … Now, my hands won’t mean nothing unless That strikes you first; then when it comes, it’ll light it off, you’ll be healed. That’s right, you’ll know you’ll be healed. See, you’ll believe it. Now, I’m going to pray now for each one of you. And now … When you do this, you put your hands over on one another too, so we’re … And you be praying for the person you got your hands on, then I’m going to bring you through the line. Put your hands on somebody that’s with you in the line. Dear God, I—I don’t know no other way of saying these things, Lord. I just know to tell what I know is the Truth, and You’re my witness tonight that I am telling the Truth. My faith, Lord, and my own healing in the future; I don’t know when, I don’t know how, I don’t understand it; but I believe It, Lord, that I received the sign from above. That seventh dove finally got here, the seventh inch is soon finished on the animal. It’s over! God, I want to serve Your people. So I pray, God, that You’ll so anoint us tonight that whoever we lay our hands on, may they be healed; not because it’s us, but because it’s following Your commandment. You said, “These signs shall follow them that believe.” Lord, help me to believe, and help their hearts to be the bedding ground of faith. And may, together, for the glory of God, every sick and afflicted person in this building (or the buildings throughout the land) that’s obeying these commands now, will be made well. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I ask it. Amen. Have faith; all of you pray with us. Now, this is not a line of discernment. [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] Depression, fear, I know what this … [The sister speaks to Brother Branham.] Poor little thing, she said she’s never seen peace in life. The same thing that I … Can’t sleep, nervous, tension. Dear God, bear me record, Lord, that I’ve told the Truth. How I feel for this little woman! I pray, God, that You’ll send to her, tonight, that streak of faith from above that knows that You are obligated to Your Word, and You’ll keep every Word. May the God of Heaven take this fear away from my sister. And I obey You by laying hands upon her and condemning it. In the Name of Jesus Christ, may it come out of her. Amen. Now, look sister, you believe me now, if you can start from right here, by the cross. From this night, deny you got it. See, go on saying, “I haven’t got it no more,” and it will leave you. Sister Palmer. [Sister Palmer speaks to Brother Branham — Ed.] Yes. Our sister, Sister Palmer; her husband is a very dear friend of mine, a minister from Georgia or Alabama, Georgia—Georgia. And she was coming up to the tabernacle … They drive, when I’m preaching up at tabernacle, fifteen hundred miles to hear one service. Brother Palmer lost control of his car, or the boy, one, when they was turning a corner, and they had a wreck. She’s got an effect of it. Let’s pray. Dear God, deliver this servant of Yours, his little wife, loyal, true, little servant in Christ, I pray, God, as I lay my hands upon her, with my Brother Jack Moore here, that You’ll heal her and make her well. In Jesus’ Name. Amen. God bless you! …?… In the right foot, and you’re standing for him? His little boy is crippled, he’s got a hurting in his stomach and back. Let’s pray. Dear God, let that snow-white Dove dip down into his heart just now, “Wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity, with His stripes we are healed.” I ask this to be so for our brother and for his little son, in Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. Severe headache pains, and a leg ailment that bothers him while he’s working. Dear God, grant Your healing blessing upon this young man, as we as servants of God lay our hands upon him. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. She has a lady’s trouble, female, and also she wants the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. Dear God, as I offer you this prayer of faith for this little lady, may the female trouble be gone, may the Baptism of the Holy Ghost come on the wings of a Dove, in Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Growth on his eye, and for his loving companion. Dear God, You know the hearts of men. I pray Thee Father, in Jesus’ Name, that You’ll grant this request that this brother’s asked; and our obedience to Your Word of laying hands on him. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. God bless you, brother. She has a growth in her left side, and also her voice is bad. Dear Jesus, I pray that You’ll heal this sister; laying hands upon her in the Name of Jesus Christ, that her healing will be. Amen. God bless you, my sister. Course, sister, I see your trouble, swollen limb. [The sister speaks to Brother Branham — Ed.] Kidney, bladder, and a ankle throwed out of place. O Father, God, heal this precious woman, Lord, I pray, as I lay hands upon her in Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. God bless you, sister; that’s the way, it’ll be done. You hear that, don’t you, on the microphone? Ever who’s at … the engineer, if you’ll step it up just a little bit, the audience can hear their testi- … or what they say when they come by. Be in prayer for them when you hear it; when I start praying, you pray with me. Dear God, I pray for this our sister, that You’ll heal her, dear God. We’re doing this because it’s Your command. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. Bless you, sister. Dear God, You hear that testimony, You hear what the enemy’s done to her. We are trying to take the Name of Jesus and defeat this enemy; he is already because the bruised, striped Dove fell in the floor of the House of God with a Message, “It’s over!” Grant it, may she believe that, Father, in Jesus’ Name. Dear God, I pray that You’ll heal this our sister. May the Dove of God witness to her tonight that He did it for her, that she could be well. In Jesus’ Name. Amen. Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother who stands here. He had enough faith to come this far, Lord, now may he receive his healing and go to his seat well. In Jesus’ Name. Dear God, I pray for our brother, laying hands upon him. Help, dear God, that the faith of God will dip down just at this time; and be like Abraham, call those things which are, as though they’re—are not, for God made the promise. In Jesus’ Name. Amen. God bless you. Dear God, You are the One who can make the true decision. I pray, dear God, as this young lady asked for this, may she receive it in Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. Dear God, I lay my hands upon our sister in obeying what You said do. This takes us back for many years, Lord, since we run a prayer line like this; but we know what happened then, we know You’re the same God today if people can have the same faith today. I pray in Jesus’ Name for our sister’s healing. Amen. Dear God, I lay my hands upon my brother here and ask for his healing, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Father, I bring before You tonight this our sister, and lay my hands upon her to witness that I’m standing as a witness of Your strength, stand as a witness of Your visions, Your Word, and I’m a witness that You are God. And I lay hands upon her in obedience to the Word of my God, and ask for her healing. Amen. Dear God, I lay hands upon my brother in like manner, as a witness of Your strength I ask for his healing in Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] “What?” She said, “The Healer.” Said that “A man from up somewhere, up in Arkansas, had been healed that morning, a blind shoe cobbler.” You know the story. It’d been on the radio. And I said … I thought … I played the part of a hypocrite. I said, “You don’t believe that’s the Truth?” She said, “Yes, sir, I do. ” And I said, “Do you believe in this day when God would do something like that, when … ” She said, “Sir, I listened to the religious program.” She said, “I’m a Christian.” She said, “I listened to the programs, I heard that man up there that was healed this morning, that blind shoe cobbler. They throwed him out of the church, he was making so much noise, one church to the other. With his hat on a cane, wiggling it around, running up-and-down the churches, everyone in the city, hollering, ‘I’m healed! I’m healed!’ A blind shoe cobbler.” I said, “Do you believe that?” And she stood there a little bit, was kind of drizzling rain, she said, “Sir, if you’ll get me in where he’s at, then I’ll find my father.” Then I felt about like that. I said, “Maybe I’m the one you’re looking for.” She said … grabbed me by the lapels of the coat, she said, “Is you the Healer?” I said, “No, sister, but I’m Brother Branham.” She said, “Have mercy!” I thought of poor old blind Fanny Crosby, “While on others Thou art calling, do not pass me by.” See, He had healed one, He could heal her. I put my hands over her eyes, I said, “Dear Jesus, one day an old rugged cross come bumping down the street, the shoulders with blood running out of them, the little frail body that was packing it fell under the load. A colored man by the name of Simon, of Cyrene, came up and picked up the cross, helped Him bear it. I’m sure You remember it, Father. And one of his children is staggering here in darkness, I’m sure You understand.” She said, “Glory to God! I can see!” Uh-huh. I said, “Can you see?” She said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “Count them lights.” And she counted them. I said, “What color suit I got on?” Said, “You got on a gray suit, with a yellow tie.” That was it, she could see. Oh, God respects humility. Uh-huh. This in itself is that which will make, and bring to pass, the tremendous victory in the Love Divine. Dear God, have mercy and heal my sister, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Dear God, as I take this feeble, wrinkling hand, only You know what’s passed through here. I pray, dear God, that the same hand I got tonight will embrace like those feeble hands of Simeon that day, “Lord, let Thy servant depart in peace, for I now see Thy salvation.” May It come upon her, Lord, Your salvation, and make her well in Jesus’ Name. Amen. [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] On The Trial, why, Mr. Unbelief indicted Jesus Christ. You remember The Trial? How that the … They had the—the attorneys and everything, and who stood for who. And we had the—the prosecuting attorney, Satan, that was going to prosecute; how the, trial was brought. And he said, one, Mr. Doubter, he come up, he said, “I heard a preacher say, ‘Anoint the sick in oil, the Bible says that.’ I was anointed in oil, wasn’t healed. The other one said, ‘Lay hands on the sick, they shall recover.’” He was trying to prosecute. But when the witness came forth, here it was, “God told them, said, ‘You’d been … ’” He said, “It’s been six months since I had hands laid on me, and Your Word says that ‘Lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.’ And hands was laid on me by one of Your anointed servants, and I haven’t recovered yet. Therefore, You’re a false pretender, because Your Word don’t mean what It says.” So when the witness come up, the true was this, that “His Word is true. He never said when He would do it, He said, ‘These signs shall follow them that believe; if they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.’ See? See, that’s what He said, ‘They shall recover.’ So whether it’s a prong miracle just happen right like this or whether it’s just obeying God, that’s up to Him in the individual. See? But if the individual believes It, I don’t care how long it takes. He said to Abraham, ‘You’re going to have a baby by Sarah.’ The baby never come for twenty-five years. He told Noah it was ‘going to rain.’ Noah had the flood … the—the ark built for the flood, many, many years before the flood came, but he knew it was going to rain. The Bible said, ‘The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and God shall raise them up.’ When? He didn’t say. God is just, He’s true, just read what His Word says.” That’s what I’ve done tonight, laid hands on the sick. Now, I believe every one of them’s going to be healed. I believe, every one of them. Do you believe the same? Now believe for these afflicted people. There’s a little lady here, seems like I ought to know, I prayed for her last night, out there in the prayer line. What’s her name? Chambers … Chambless. If that little lady would have lived—would have lived normally, wouldn’t been afflicted, she certainly been a beautiful woman. And she’s setting there now, shaking. Lovely, fine spirit in the girl. And she sets there jerking like this. Oh, how that breaks my heart. How that I’ve wished … just how I would! Here’s a little baby, lady setting here holding it. Its little tongue hanging out, its little body afflicted. What if that was my little Joseph? What if it was my little grandson Paul? What if that was Rebekah setting back there, or Sarah? What if Mrs. Simpson here was my wife Meda? This young man setting here was Billy Paul? This aged woman setting here was my mother? Remember, it’s somebody’s baby, somebody’s sister, somebody’s daughter, and somebody’s son. See? I am their brother, He is our Saviour. All that I can do is … what faith I’ve got is offered in their behalf. That’s all I know. Now, the Lord can show me a vision, He could tell me what’s the matter with each one of them. I can prove that to you, see, you know that. But that don’t heal them. That doesn’t heal them. No, it’s got to be something drop in them, see. And I hope … Like I could go up here take each one of you and baptize you in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that won’t remit your sins. No, no! No, I don’t believe in water baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ unto regeneration; I believe the Blood is regeneration, see, not—not the water. But, see, I could baptize and baptize, but you only go down a dry sinner, come up a wet one; see, until you have thoroughly repented. Repent, and then be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. See? And that’s where I different with the Oneness movement. Not baptizing to regeneration, no; I believe it’s the Blood that cleanses, not the water. See? Repentance, and then be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ. Now I’m going down to pray. And these people are just as much to you as they are to me, maybe even more in that line of relation. Now let’s all join together, and your hands in faith, and my hand in faith, bringing down the hands of the Lord Jesus to lay on these poor crippled people. Will you pray with me? [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] Those with handkerchiefs that’s for the sick and the afflicted, you may get them right after service. Now help me pray for these, will you? God, we thank You, Lord, for what You have done tonight. We thank You in advance for the healing of every person come through the line. Dear God, I pray over these handkerchiefs, perhaps for some who could not even come to the meeting, and their loved ones brought the handkerchiefs. In the Bible we’re taught that they took from the body of Paul, handkerchiefs or aprons. Now, those people back there had lived in Your presence, they had seen You on the street, they had seen You in their meeting, and they had seen Your same Spirit upon Paul. And they knew it wasn’t that man, it was Your Spirit that was dominating his life, for we see Paul doing the same things that You did. And now, Lord, the people of this day sees the same God living in His Church with His people. And they’ve brought these handkerchiefs, that they might be taken from here to their loved ones. Grant, God, that every one of them will be healed in Your own way. We don’t request any certain thing to be done of any certain way or any certain nature; we just ask, “In Your own way, Father, heal them.” For the glory of God, I offer this prayer of faith over it. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. I’ve had a wonderful time of fellowship around your faith, your presence in Jesus Christ. This will be a meeting that I’ll long remember of what taken place: love, cooperation, fellowship. And now, till we meet again, may God of Heaven guide you. He Who makes the stars to shine bright at night to lighten up the path when it’s growing dim, may He lighten your path with the Star of Bethlehem to guide you to a full surrendered life in His Word, is my prayer. Till we meet, till we meet, Till we meet at Jesus’ feet; Till we meet, till we meet, God be with you till we meet again. Now let us stand. My Faith Looks Up to Thee! …?… I … well, I’ll change that. I believe that’s fine. (Excuse me.) My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour Divine! Now hear me while I pray, Take all my sin away, O let me from this day Be wholly Thine! Now let’s shake one anothers’ hands when they sing. While life’s dark maze I tread, And griefs around me spread, Be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow’s tears away, Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside. Feel better now, don’t you? On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Now on the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. That’s our closing message for this campaign. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. Bow our head. As the wheels hum a song going home, I trust it’ll … you’d hear the humming of the wheels, the roaring of the engine. On the wings of a snow-white dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. [Brother Branham begins humming the chorus — Ed.]  … dove, God sends His pure, sweet love, A sign from above, On the wings of a dove. With your heads bowed, I give you to your … Brother Noel. 
The chapter here at—at Yuma, it’s a grand privilege to have this invitation to come back again. We had a wonderful time, the last time here. And then when I understood I was to be back again, it made me feel real good, to hear the testimonies and these fine words from the people, and kind of boosts you up a little. Billy told me that the brother from Las Vegas, that wanted a meeting there at the chapter, see him immediately after the service is over here. We have a time, he says, that we can slip in, right over in January, before the Phoenix meeting, see, to come to Las Vegas. And so we’ve always wanted to get there. I believe Brother Art Wilson used to be there, a long time ago, or he may still be there. And he—he asked me come up, he and Sister Wilson. I didn’t get the opportunity, so maybe this will be the time I could come. You just see Billy Paul or Brother Roy Borders. I think he’s here somewhere. Somebody said Brother Roy was in. Brother Pearry, Lee, or any of them, they’ll be able to tell you. Just set the dates for us to come. Now, I seen many ministers here, a while ago, to which I’m very happy to meet my brethren. Wish I had time, go home with you, ’cause I know you got the best cook there is in the country. That’s fine. And now, Brother Pearry really got two, tonight, on him. He got two marks against him now. One of them, cutting that microphone in, out there. When, you’re—you’re held guilty of that, Brother Pearry. I don’t think you really were guilty. But you … Somebody was fixing to speak. That was a good one. And so then, again, he went out there and was talking. He said, “Say!” Telling Brother Collins or some of them. Said, “The supper was good. But,” said, “I’m telling you,” said, “that man must be a Spaniard or something, or a Mexican. That was the hottest pepper I ever taste.” Going on like that, and he was talking to the chef. He said, “I’m the chef.” That’s Texas, for you. We’ll get him straightened out, over here in Arizona, after while, (won’t we?), if he stay around us. Really nice to be here! And I guess those don’t sound like jokes, but sense of humor. Which, the Lord Hisself had a sense of humor, you know. He said, “‘Herod,’ go tell that fox, see, ‘today I cast out—cast out devils; tomorrow I’m made perfect.’” So, He had a sense of humor. Well, it won’t hurt us, I don’t think, once in a while. And now it’s a little late. And, usually, I—I preach about four hours. So this, knowing the courtesy of the brother and sister here, the chapter, we’ll cut that way down, tonight. And just … I told Terry. I said … He said, “What’s … Put on a two-hour tape?” I said, “No, Terry. This is a—a banquet.” I said, “Just about thirty or forty minutes, speak to the people of something.” That, I’d try, though, each time, knowing that. When I was a little boy, people used to come out to listen because I was a boy preacher, just a young fellow, a chap. And they’d say, “Well, Billy Branham, you know, just a kid, never went through school, and no education.” And they’d come out to hear my broken words, my Kentucky English, and—and so they … my “hits, and hain’ts, and totes, and carry.” Like in one of the meetings here not long ago, they said, “We’ll all stand up and sing the national anthem.” I got up and said, “For my old Kentucky home far away.” That was the only nation I knowed about, so it was national anthem, as far as I was concerned. So now, after you got older, though, well, we, he come in, you got to have something more than that. See? We’re take … Paul said, “When I was a child, I spake as a child and thought as a child. You act as a child.” But as you grow older, then you begin, from making your first couple steps, and tottle and fall, and get up and try it again. Then you, after while, you get so you can walk a straight line. And that’s what we have to do, as soldiers of the cross. Now is time to walk a straight line, right down that highway to Glory. I do believe that we are living in the closing scenes of the history of this world. I truly believe that the Coming of the Lord is closer, perhaps, than we think. So now, for just about thirty minutes of your time, or something, I would like to call your attention to a Scripture that I’d like to use for a text, and—and refer to some more here. I … Setting at home, the other day, I was thinking on this thought. Then I thought, “Well, I don’t know, speaking from all this Scripture. I’ll just take part of It, and just for these little short services like we would have tonight.” I want to say one thing, while you’re turning over to Psalms. The—the first … The 27th Psalm, I want first five verses, to read. Would like to say this, concerning this businessmen’s Full Gospel Business Men’s chapters. My Brother Pearry was speaking about the books, and so forth, and the new books that they got. How many remembers when we had the tape, and preached it over here at Phoenix, at one of the conventions, of Sirs, What Time Is It? Now, that was the beginning of that book, you see, when these … this taken place. There’s too much supernatural vindication of God’s written Word, of this hour, for something not to be approaching us now. We’re just … It’s too real. The things that you … It would be astounding, to you, just to let you know that what is really taking place. Many of you, strangers, perhaps, hear these men get up and make—make these remarks, about, “A Message of this hour,” and so forth. What they are getting at, is God’s promise of this hour, that He promised what He would do. And we see Him Scripturally vindicating just exactly what He said He would do, in the same manner. Foretold, hits just exactly perfectly, each time, because it’s God saying it. If a man, I don’t care who he was, will try to make such a prediction, there’s one chance out of ten million. If a man told you a certain thing would happen, it would—it would happen at a certain time; one out of ten million. And then the place it would happen, would be about one chance out of about a hundred million. And then the time it would happen, goes on and on, and the way it will happen, and what it will be happening, and so forth, it’s just beyond a guess. When we see it so perfectly, each and every time, then it’s God. And then we turn right back in the Scriptures. It may seem foreign to us. But we turn right back in the Scriptures, without even knowing where to look, and the Holy Spirit brings out and just puts the whole Word together, makes the picture there to show us just the hour that we’re living in. We’re changing dispensations. We’re—we’re at a corner. It’s easy when somebody turns a corner, of a brick mason, turns a corner. Starts, everybody laying the bricks right down the same row, like a certain denomination starts, and starts rolling down the row, it’s all right. But, when you get to them turns, where you have to turn back the other way! Now, God isn’t building a wall. He’s building a house, see, and there’s many cuts and turns that He’s predicted here in the Bible. And the turns, anybody could try to make a turn, but it must be according to the blueprint. If it isn’t, it’s got to be torn down again. So we—we praise God for His goodness and the fellowship of you people, and the open doors that the Lord has given us, and through this businessmen. I’ve always contended that I—I didn’t believe in … I believe in the people in denominations. But I don’t have much time to exhort denominations, because each one builds a fence around himself. And—and just like, I believe, it was Brother David’s little saying, about he was raising some ducks, and said the river come up. And each duck, you know, they wanted fellowship with one another, and they couldn’t do it because they was all fenced up. But when the water got so high, it just floated the ducks out of the pen. So I—I think that’s the way to do it. Is just the water is coming up, see, and we can get out of the pen and—and fellowship with one another, you know, have the real love of Christ in our hearts. And this Full Gospel Business Men has been an—an oasis for me. Because, many times … I have brothers, fine brothers in, I guess, every denomination I’ve ever met: Presbyterians, Lutheran, Baptists, Pentecostals, all different types of the Pentecostals, church of God, and Nazarenes, Pilgrim Holiness. Fine brethren, everywhere. But, many times, they cannot have me in their community, because, see, not that they don’t believe it, but, see, it would cut them off from their denomination. And when you do that, course, that—that does it. Here not long ago, there was a Methodist brother came to me, I won’t call his name. A fine man, he was writing a thesis on Divine healing, and he come to me for some—some talk. We set down and talked a little while. He said, “The only thing we got against you, you’re hanging around them Pentecostals all the time.” I said, “Then, let the Methodist church sponsor it. I’ll come.” That was different. See? He—he said, “Well, of course, I—I’m not the Methodist church. I just belong with them.” I said, “That’s it. See? They’re the ones, the Pentecostals, is the ones that open their doors. See? That’s the ones I can get to. And as many as them that will open, why, we’re ready to come in.” Like in the Revelation, the 3rd chapter, said, “I stand at the door and knock. If any man will open the door, I’ll come in and sup.” And that was Jesus. All of us knows that was Christ, and He is the Word. That’s right. He is the Word. And so the Full Gospel Business Men has been a oasis where we can come together. No churches is sponsoring it. They all, together, the—the men out of the churches, and we come together and fellowship, cross the world, around everywhere. And I’ve helped establish many, many, many chapters throughout the entire world, of the Full Gospel Business Men. I’m thankful for that opportunity that was given me. In there, the businessmen will sponsor it. Then, all the churches, they—they want to come, anyhow. But, then, if … I don’t want to never try to pull somebody from their church. Just stay right in your church and scatter out the Light. See? Be a real Christian. Your pastor will appreciate you. A real, loyal, genuine saint, any man that believes in God will appreciate a person like that. Yes. Now, I thank the brother here, and his wife, and this chapter, for this opportunity. And may this chapter grow. May the blessings of God rest upon it, and be an instrument in God’s hands, to save hundreds and hundreds of people before the Coming of the Lord; and all the rest of you chapters or representatives here from the chapters. In the Book of Psalms, now, I want to speak on a—a real strange subject, tonight, just for a little while. I got some Scriptures written down here. And—and I thought maybe that, tonight, I was going to speak on something different. But, see the time get away, why, I didn’t want to stay that long, so I just turned over here and got some more Scripture. And I want to speak on the subject of: The Rapture. See? Now, we believe that there will be a Rapture. All Christians believe that, that’s Bible readers, believes that there will be a Rapture. And now to read for some background, we read the 25th Psalm. I mean … I beg your pardon. The 27th Psalm, 1 to 5 verses. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, come upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumble and fell. Though the host should encamp about me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this I will be confident. One thing have I desired of the LORD, that I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to require in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in the pavilion: and in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up on a rock. May the Lord add His blessings to that reading of His Word. Now, today, speaking on this subject, and now some of you may different, the—the avenues that I take. But how many in here believes that the Bible teaches there will a Rapture of the Church? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] Yes, sir. That’s right, exactly, a catching away of the Church. Whether you’re a Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or whoever you are, Pentecostal, there will be a catching away. And I think that, in speaking, I—I just don’t try to get up here to say something that I think would please the people. I’ve never been guilty of that. I want to get up here and say something as I feel led to say it, that I think would be a help to you, something that would further your experience with God, if you are a Christian; and if you’re not a Christian, make you so ashamed of yourself, that you will become a Christian. And that’s the purpose that I’ve always tried to line up my thoughts, as the Lord would lead me. Now, we are warned, as in the Doctrine of This in the last days will be scorned at. If you would, let’s just read That, just a minute. It’s in Second Peter, the 3rd chapter. Let’s read just a moment on this. The 3rd chapter, and the 3rd and 4th verses. Let’s see if this isn’t right. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? … since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and the wa- … and in the water: Whereby the worlds that … was, being overflowed with water, perished: Now we see that, the reason that this subject is so lightened at, is because that the prophet here has said that in this last days these scoffers would come saying these things. See? It’s predicted, the reason the people are acting today the way they’re acting. Why, you certainly are expecting it, because the Bible said that. “In the last days they’d be heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God; trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, despisers of those that are good; having a form of godliness, and denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” Can we look for an impersonation of Truth? Certainly. When Moses went down into Egypt, to deliver the children of Israel, with only a stick in his hand for vindication, with the God of Heaven behind him, he performed a miracle. There come impersonators behind him, and doing the same thing he did. See? Now, they come second, after he did it first. Then they come around, because they were copying after what he did, impersonating the original. We find that. And now you say, “Well, that was in the days of Moses.” But the same Scripture says that they’ll come again in the last days. “A Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so will these men of reprobate mind concerning Truth.” See? Impersonations, all kinds of things to upset people. And then if … This Rapture which is coming to pass, and anything that God has in the line of His Word, there’s always something to come out to upset That if they can. It’s—it’s—it’s Satan’s purpose to do that. As the brother here, from the meeting up there at Las Vegas, said, “Satan said the world was his dominion, and—and that being his headquarters up there.” I know that Satan is the god of this world. Every nation under heaven is controlled by him. Exactly. This world belongs to Satan, but Jesus will take it over. He offered it to Him one day. And He refused it, but, He said, ’cause He knowed He’d be Heir to it in the times to come. “Scoffers.” Just us take for a few moments on that one word, before we go further. Scoffers! I was reading a paper, about two weeks ago, in Tucson, that where some Englishman from England had made a statement. It’s in headlines in the paper, that the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ was only faked, between Pilate and Jesus, that He come to make … just to make Himself something. And there’s no way that we could disprove that to them, because all the things of God is to be received by faith. We must believe it. Now, he went ahead to give a description how that that could be done. Here not long ago, in that great nation, London, in England, rather, where that John Wesley and Charles, and many of those great preachers of the early days, Spurgeon and them, had preached the Gospel in the hay markets and everywhere there. They turned down that message of their day, and look what they are in this day. There is where Brother Williams and them are tonight. It’s one of the lowest degraded countries in the world. I’ve been over the world, but I don’t know anything that’s so illegitimate as England. It’s … Billy Graham said the same thing. Why, he had to take his wife from the parks, how the—the—the acts of between men and women were going on, publicly, in the parks. When I was there, I never seen anything would break a person’s heart any more than what was going on in England; which had the opportunity, and, one time, led the world in a reformation. Just shows how it can fall. But, you see, what does that, the message that went forth then, the Englishmen try to hold that same message for today. That won’t work today. It won’t work. How would … What if Moses would have come, would, brought Noah’s Message, “We’ll build an ark and float down the Nile”? It wouldn’t have worked. And neither would Jesus’ Message have ever worked of Moses. And neither will Wesley’s Message ever work in Luther; or Luther’s Wes- … message, vice versa. And today, we, our last great reformation was Pentecost. And today we’re moving from that. And the Pentecostal message won’t mix with This, because it’s another day. It’s all the Word of God, but it’s building. Like the feet, arms, coming up, it’s forming a Bride for the Rapture. See? Don’t—don’t displace them people back there; they lived to their Message. All them will come out, that was in the Bride. Just like life going through a stalk of wheat. It leaves the wheat, the hull, but the wheat forms itself like the grain of wheat that fell in the ground. Here not long ago, I was reading a book some German wrote, in criticism. He said, “Of all of the—of the fanatics in the world, William Branham tops them all.” He said, “Why, he’s nothing but a … He’s a—he’s a magician. He does these things.” See, the man, not knowing. And, then, the man was a critic. He didn’t even believe in God. He said, “A God that could set up in the dark ages, hold His hands across His tummy, and laugh at a bunch of Christians; being mothers, and His Own disciples, was supposed to be; mothers with little children and things, and let lions eat them up; and never even turn a hand.” You see where the carnal mind, where education and things, can’t catch the vision? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] That corn of wheat had to fall into the ground. Just like Jesus had to fall, to rise again, so did the church of pentecost had to fall. It had to go into the ground, them dark ages. Any wheat that … Any grain that goes into the ground, it has to lay in that dark time, to bring forth. But it started sprouting in Martin Luther. Come on through Wesley. On out into Pentecost. Now in, to go out to the grain. And now the denominational systems that they left behind, they’re stalks, that’s all. It’s to be burnt, the denominational system. But the real grain of wheat that come out of each one of those reformations will be caught up in the Bride. It all altogether will make the Bride. Now we find out, in England there, they impersonated the crucifixion, not long ago, a bunch of those people, them long … kids with them long hair and things, and hollering, called Jesus “daddy-o” and all that stuff. Such scum! Now you say, “That’s in London, England.” Watch what was in the paper last week, here in Americas. Some great doctor of divinity, from a fine school, said that the—the crucifixion was a fake. Said that, “Jesus only tried to make Hisself like that; that He had dranken this mandrake weed.” And we find it in Genesis, where it’s spoke of. It’s a weed like marijuana or something. It’s found in the Orients there. And if you drink it, it’ll put you to sleep. Maybe … And you’re like you’re dead, slump, everything, for two or three days at a time. He said, “When they give Him vinegar and gall, it’s all possible that that was mandrake weed. And when they did, they give Him that, and He went slump like He was dead. They put Him in the tomb, and they laid Him there. After two or three days, sure, going back, then He was awake again, was all right.” Said, “He went up in India and died somewhere, an ordinary death, trying to fake a religion.” The first place, that critic, what’s the matter with people? See, it’s just this day we’re living in, scoffers, see, the day to fulfill the prophecy. God lotted His Word out to each age, and each one of those age has to manifest that. And He also foreordained men for that age, to fulfill that Word. Every time He lotted His Word, He lotted a man for It. When He lotted Moses’ time, He lotted Moses to It. When He lotted the time for the Son of God to be born, He lotted Him to it. Every age, He’s lotted His man, foreordained, as the Bible said. Nothing … If God is infinite, Almighty, all powerful, omnipresent, omniscient, why, He knowed all things from the beginning. So, He knowed. There’s nothing out of cater. It’s just us that thinks it is. It’s everything run. Look back in His Word and see what He’s doing, then we’ll have an understanding. Now, just think. The first place, if that minister would have thought, when they put that vinegar and gall in His mouth, He spit it out. He did not take it, at the first place. See? Just scoffers rising! Another thing, how did this Jesus of Nazareth, how did His life fit every prophecy of the Old Testament? How could it been? It couldn’t have been without it been ordained of God. His life fit every prophecy of the Old Testament. Another thing, if those disciples had faked Him like that, why did each one of them die in martyrdom? And even apostle Peter said, “Turn my head upside down. I’m not worthy to die like Him.” How they took Andrew and turned him sideways on the cross. They, every one, sealed their testimony in their own blood. They believed Him and loved Him, and gave their lives for Him. If He was a faker, how would they ever done that? See? The spiritual application, the people don’t get it. Here was a great man here, not long ago, some great rabbi that wrote that, “Moses, while passing through the Red Sea,” said, “it wasn’t actually water. The waters never walled up.” Said, “What it was, up at the other end of the Dead Sea, there was a bunch of reeds. And he passed through the water reeds, the reeds of the water. No water in there. Just a bunch of reeds, an ocean of—of reeds they passed through.” And many clergymen believe it, they, and accept it. Here not long ago, when this first astronaut went up, he come back, and he hadn’t seen nothing of God. That even turned ministers around. They thought God lived right up there somewhere, a hundred and fifty miles high. Why, my, how education and wisdom of this world has turned the church into a bunch of ragweeds! The … Its education and the educational system, science and civilization, is of the devil. It’s the devil’s civilization. The Bible said so. And our Civilization that’s coming on will have nothing to do with this civilization, at all. It’s nothing of it, at all. There’ll be a different Civilization, into this civilization and this scientific world we got. More science, scientific we get, further we go into death things, traps to kill, and everything. In that new Civilization, there’ll be no death, no sickness, sorrow, or no pain. See? There won’t be none in There. So this civilization will have to be destroyed, because it’s of the devil. We find out, that in Genesis 4, that Cain’s people started civilization, building towns and cities, and so forth, and instruments of music, and become in science. And the people got further away from God, yet religious. But when Seth’s people come on, they begin to come on, call on the Name of the Lord. Ah, talk about a subtle one! I’m not here to hurt anybody’s feelings, say something about a church. And if you’re here, and belong to this church, I’m not saying this to hurt your feeling; ’cause just as many good people in there, as there is in other churches. But I was reading in Shreveport last week, where the Catholic church made a statement. And we see where they’re all coming together now at the great ecumenical council, and so forth, just exactly fulfilling what the Bible said they’d do. Just exactly. Now we find out they said, “Why, the Bible … ” Some of the Protestants want to hold to that Bible. “Why,” said, “the Bible was nothing but a book, a history of the church, and they didn’t have it in literature till about two hundred fifty years ago. It’s always been the church.” Said, “It was the church, not the Bible, and the Bible is just a history of what the church did.” What a subtle lie that is! Why, we’ve had the Bible for three thousand years. The Old Testament was been written in Scripture, for hundreds and hundred of years before the coming of Christ. Just a subtle thing of the devil! And we find out in this day, when this great scoffing and making fun of the Bible, and trying to push It out, God has got to judge the church by something. He can’t be just … They can’t go down this street and arrest me, and say I’m making thirty miles an hour in a twenty mile zone, unless there’s something there to tell me that I’m only allowed to go twenty miles. It has to be there. And God is going to judge the church, is going to judge the people, someday. We know that. There’s a Judgment coming. So if He’s going to judge it by the Catholic church, which Catholic church? If He’s going to judge it by the Methodist, the Baptist is lost. If He judge it by the oneness, the twoness is lost. See? What’s He going to judge it by? He said He would judge it by Christ, and Christ is the Word. So it’s the Word of God, that God will judge. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The same yesterday, today, and forever.” See? So, He’ll judge it by His Word. And now we find out that in this day, when they’re trying to push the Bible out, “Accept the church. The Bible; don’t want It. The church,” so they can just make any kind of a creed or anything else, and walk by it. Well, as I was speaking the other night at Shreveport. In the—the communion, when they kill that sacrificial lamb, there was to be “no leaven among them, through the entire seven days,” no leaven, no leaven bread. Everything had to be unleaven. That represented the seven church ages that we get in the book here, and there’s no leaven. What? It’s something mixed with It. And we mix creed and denomination, everything else, with the Word, and still try to call it the Word. “No leaven, shall be the entire seven day.” And even what is eat today, don’t try to keep it for tomorrow. “Burn it with fire, before daylight come,” for there’s a new Message coming forth, and a new thing. See, try to hold it over, but that’s been the attitude of the church. A revival goes forth, and the first thing you know, within about three years, they start an organization over it. A denomination starts, organization. But have you noticed? This has been sweeping for twenty years now, and there’s no organization. And there never will be. This is the end. The wheat has come back to the wheat again. The wheat has come back to Its grain. The shuck has pulled away from It. And the wheat must lay in the Presence of the Son, to be ripened. Isn’t it a strange thing, that, not long ago, on the East Coast, the big blackout? They couldn’t understand it. Texas blacked out, last week. They can’t understand it. Don’t you realize that that’s a sign? Don’t you know the nations are breaking? Israel is in her homeland. And these signs are indicating that we are at the end. The same time it’s blacking out, don’t you know that’s a sign that the prophet said? Yeah. “But there shall be Light about the evening time,” that there will be a Light come forth in the evening time, when the blackouts and things are going the way they are now. Look at just how it blacked out. The pope just come over here. ’Member, at the tabernacle, when them … You got tapes. I guess, all of you take them. How that the Lord showed there that day, in the tabernacle, exactly where those church ages would be and how they would be! I had them drawed out on the board up there, them church ages which you see here drawed out in a book. And if that Holy Spirit didn’t come down in a big Pillar of Fire, and went right back there on that wall and drawed them out, Hisself, while three or four hundred people setting, looking at It! And just as the pope started over here, the moon somehow blacked out. And they took their pictures the same way that it was drawed up there on the platform. Now he’s made his trip over here on the thirteenth, walked thirteen steps, served communion to thirteen, to a nation that’s number thirteen, and blackouts coming everywhere. Don’t you see where we’re at? We’re at the end time. “Scoffers shall rise in the last day, saying, ‘There’s no difference in the time than what it was, than when our fathers fell asleep.’” But when you see these things begin to happen, raise up your head, get ready. Something could happen at any time, Christ come for His Church. Now, they don’t believe it, because it is a … it’s a … They, they’re suppo- … They don’t realize that they’re the ones that’s fulfilling the Scriptures. The people really don’t realize that, doing these things and saying these things, they’re fulfilling the Scriptures. How little did Caiaphas, the high priest, and all those priests in that day, that scoffed and made fun of Him, didn’t know that, the very God that they were singing about, “My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?” The 22nd Psalm, “My hands and My feet they pierced.” Singing that in the temple, and Him dying out there on the cross. Little did they know they were doing it. Even Jesus prayed, “Father, forgive them. They don’t know what they’re doing.” Because, they were actually predicted, by the Scriptures, to be blind. Did you know the Protestant and Catholic church is predicted, in the last days, to be blind, the same thing, to the Scriptures, with Christ on the outside, trying to get in? “Because thou sayest, ‘I am rich, and have need of nothing,’ knowest thou not that thou art miserable, poor, wretched, naked, and blind, and don’t know it,” Revelation 3. There you are, back to the blindness again, trampling over the things of God, as if (they) It didn’t mean nothing to them, scoffing and making fun of It. That’s what the Bible said. But, to the Church, the Bride, the Rapture is a revelation to Her. It’s revealed to Her. That, the revelation, the true Bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture. Now, it is a revelation, for the revelation is faith. You cannot have a revelation without it being faith. Faith is a revelation, because it’s something that’s revealed to you. Faith is a revelation. Faith is something that has been revealed to you, like it was to Abraham, that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed to him, as though it wasn’t so. Now, faith, that’s what faith is, is the revelation of God. The Church is built upon a revelation, the whole entire Body. Here a few weeks ago, I was talking to a fine Baptist minister. He come up to discuss with me. He said, “I like you as a man, but,” said, “you’re all mixed up.” I said, “Then, I pray you help me get straightened out,” (he said … ) “with the Scripture.” He said, “We’ll never be able, Brother Branham, to get the things together till we get every Word upon Word, upon Word, exactly with the Greek, and so forth.” I said, “Oh, sir, you know better than that.” I said, “Even in the Nicaea Council, way back as far as that, three hundred years from the death of Christ, they were still debating which Greek scholar was right. You can know. It’s a revelation, the whole thing. Is re- … ” He said, “I cannot accept revelation.” I said, “Then how can you accept Christ?” He said, “Why, the Bible said, ‘He that believeth is … on Jesus Christ, has everlasting Life.’” I said, “That is true. It also says that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the revelation of the Holy Ghost that’s revealed it to him.” See? There you are, right back around again, falls right back to the revelation. It’s got to be revealed, in the Bible. Cain and Abel didn’t have a Bible to read, but it was revealed to Abel, by faith, which is a revelation. Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain. Which, God testified that he was righteous. When Jesus was asked here, Matthew 16:17 and 18. We haven’t time to read it, but if you want to write it down. He said, “Who does man say I the Son of man am?” “One of them said You’re ‘Moses, Elias, or so forth.’” He said, “But Who do you say I am?” He said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” He said, “Blessed art thou, Simon, son of Jonas, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you. My Father which is in Heaven has revealed This to you. Upon this rock,” the spiritual revelation of Who God is, Who Jesus is. And He is the revelation of God, God made in flesh and revealed to the world. “He was in the world. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself, revealing what God was, in a body of flesh.” “Thou art the Christ, the anointed One, the Son of God.” He said, “Flesh and blood never revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you. Upon this rock I’ll build My Church, the revelation of the Word in Its season. I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell cannot prevail against It.” The Book of the Revelation is the last Book of the Bible. It’s sealed to unbelievers. In there, the Bible says, in 22nd chapter, “Whosoever shall take one Word from It, or add one word to It, I’ll take his part from the Book of Life.” We realize that, then, it was altogether given for believers. And It opens the Book of Revelation and reveals Who the Author of this entire Book is. “He is to look upon as Alpha and Omega,” from Genesis to Revelation, Jesus Christ just the same, right straight through. And reveals His complete mystery of Himself, and His plans for His church ages that’s to come, and was sealed in there by Seven Seals. Now, the Book was written, but then, remember, It was sealed with Seven Seals. And these Seven Seals was not to be opened (Revelation 10) until the sounding of the last earthly angel on earth, Revelation 10:7. See? “And in the days of the sounding of the last angel’s Message, seventh angel, the mystery of God should be finished in that age.” That, and that’s the age that we’re living in. We all know we’re living in the Laodicea Age. There will never be another age to it. It can’t be. So, we’re living in the Laodicea Age. And these Seven Seals that’s held that Book, is a mystery to people, should be opened at that day. That’s what He promised. Now, it won’t be nothing outside the Word, because you can’t add to the Word or take from the Word. It’s got to remain always the Word. But the revelation is to reveal the Truth of It, what It is, to make It fit with the rest the Scripture. And then God vindicates that to be the Truth. See? God don’t need no interpreter. He is His Own interpreter. He does His Own interpretation by bringing to pass the things that He said would happen. Like, in the beginning, He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. That don’t need any interpretation. It was vindicated. Now, He promised certain things in this last day, in the Scripture. Why, there it was. That’s how Jesus was the Son of God. He promised to send Him. When He was in His days here on earth, and the people couldn’t believe Him, He said, “Search the Scripture, for in Them you think you have Eternal Life, and They are They that testify of Me. If I do not the works of My Father, then believe Me not. But if you can’t believe Me, believe the works that I do, ’cause they testify Who I am.” Well, then, in Wesley’s age, the works that he did testified who he was. In Luther’s age, on reformation, why, sure, it testified who he was. In the days of the Pentecostals, the restoring back of the gifts, the restoration of the gifts, speaking in tongues and casting out devils, and the gifts, why, it testified. There was no joke about it. People said, when it first raised up … I read the books on the history of Pentecost. They said, “It can’t last long. It’ll burn down.” It’s still burning. Why? Is because you’ll never put it out. God said it would be there. It’s that portion of the Word, and no more could you put that out. And then when the Bride is being called out, how you going to put it out? It’s the revelation of the manifestation of the Word made true. And we’re living in that day; praise be to God; the revelation of the mystery of Hisself. Now, the Rapture is only … This Rapture that we’re talking about, is only for the Bride. Remember, the Bible said, “And the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years.” This great Rapture! If there’s not a Rapture, friends, where are we at? What are we going to do? What age are we living in? What promise do we have? There is going to be a Rapture. The Bible says there will be. And it’ll be only for the elected, the Elected Lady, the Bride in this day, that’s pulled out, the Church. The wor- … very word, church, means “called out of.” As Moses called a nation out of a nation, the Holy Spirit is calling a Bride out of a church; a Church out of a church; members, from every denomination, making up a Bride, Bride tree. It’s in the—in the tape, The Bride Tree. A Bride coming out, call, and that’s the one that the Bride tree is. The—the Bride, rather, is the One that’s going to be in the Rapture; that, alone, nothing but the Bride, the elected ones foreknown by God from the beginning, the Father’s spiritual genes. Let me just stop here a minute. And I keep getting nervous, thinking I’m going to hold you, going to hold you too long. But, notice, look, each one of you people. Do you know, years before you were born, you were in your father as a gene? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] That’s right. A germ, a seed, was in your father; comes from the male sex, not the female. See? Female furnishes the egg, a bedding ground. But the germ come from the fa- … Now, say, in my father … Or, my son setting here, when I was sixteen years old, my son was in me. I didn’t know him, but he was there. Now, through a bedding ground, through holy wedlock, he becomes in the image of me. I know him. I can fellowship with him. And he come just at the time when it’s the right time. Now, so were you in, if you’ve got Eternal Life, you were a … in God before there ever was a world. You are a part, a son of God, an attribute of God. He knowed the very age you were coming. He predestinated you to that age, to take that place, and no one else can take it; care how many impersonations and things. You’ve got to be there, because He knew you would be there. Now you are made manifest. Now you can fellowship with Him, and that’s what He wants. He’s longing for fellowship, to be worshipped. But if your life did not … always was as an attribute in God, you’re just a mimic of Christianity. See? There’ll be millions and billions of them, they’ll just be mimics of Christianity. A remark that I made just recently. I was watching Brother Demos Shakarian over there, when they was having hybreeding cattle, watch the test tubes, and so forth, being taken in by doctors, and watching these things. In the literal discharge of the male, there’s somewhat a million germs comes forth from the male at each time. And somewhat a million eggs comes from the female at—at the same time. But did you know, in all them little germs moving around, a million of them, there is only one of them ordained to life, and there’s only one egg fertile? And that little germ will crawl right up through every one of them other little germs, right over the top of every little germ looking just like him, and come over the top of that and come over here, and find that fertile egg and crawl into it. And then all the rest of them die. Why, talk about the virgin birth, oh, it’s not half as mysterious as a physical birth, how it’s foreordained, predestinated by God! Now, in the beginning, way back, way years ago before there was a time began, you, if you are a born-again Christian, tonight, you were in God then, your Father. That’s why, when you come into this life here and profess Christianity, well, everything going wrong, you’ve wondered why this is, and all this. It, you wondered at it. But, one day, Something struck you. What was It? That Life that was down in there, from the beginning. And if it … Like my little story about the eagle, finding it, its mother finding the eagle. You’ve heard me preach on that, how that little eagle was hatched under a hen. But she, her habits of trying to feed them—them chickens, the little eagle couldn’t stomach it, because he wasn’t a chicken, to begin with. Yet, he was in the pen with the chickens, and follow the chicken. But she would scratch in the barnyard and things, and the little eagle couldn’t stand it. But every time she would cluck and everything, all the little chickens go, so he would go too. But one day … His mother knew that she had laid two eggs, not one. There had to be another one, somewhere. She went to hunt it, flying around, circling. Finally she come over the barnyard, and she found her baby, and she screamed to him. It was a voice, that, he realized that that’s the thing that fit. That was what he’s looking for, see, and he realized then that he wasn’t a chicken. He was an eagle. And that’s the way, every born-again Christian, when you come. I don’t care how many denominations you joined, how many names, you put your name on the books and things. When that real Word of God is vindicated and made true before you like that, you realize you’re an eagle, right there. Because, all this clucking of the hen, “You join this and join this, and go this way and that way,” it’s nonsense. It’s a genuine, adding Word to Word. When a germ comes into the womb of—of the female, it don’t take on … You, you didn’t become a human germ from your father, and then the next thing you become a germ from a dog, and the next thing from a cat, the next thing from a chicken. It was all human germ. And the Body of Jesus Christ, the Bride, will be part of His Body. Which will … He was the Word, and the Bride will have to be the Word; Word added to Word, add to Word. Luther’s justification, Wesley’s sanctification, pentecostal’s baptism of the Holy Spirit, restoration of the gifts, and all the rest of It, goes with It. See? It’s got to be Word on top of Word, germ on top of germ, Life on top of Life, to bring out the full stature of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, remember, you was an attribute. And now, the thing of it is, after we find out these things, that Christ is coming for His Bride, now how do we get into that Bride? That’s the question. Many say, “Join our congregation.” One of them wants a certain type of baptism. One wants to do this or that. One said, “You must speak with tongues, or you haven’t got It.” The other one said, “You don’t have to speak with tongues.” This one says, “You must dance in the spirit.” This says, “You must shout.” This, “Got a sensation.” It’s all all right, and then, still, it’s all wrong. How could a man that’s … or a woman, or a child of God, that’s born of the Spirit of God, deny the Word of God? When, God Himself interpret It and say, “This is It. I promised It. Here It is,” showing It just as plain as It can. Why, they’re bound to see It. See? How could Christ deny His Own Word? And if Christ is in you, It can’t deny His Own Word. Then how do we get into this Body? First Corinthians 12, “By one Spirit we’re all baptized into this Body, by one Holy Spirit baptism.” That, if you want to put that down, it’s First Corinthians 12:13. “And by one Spirit we are all baptized.” And the Spirit is the Life of Christ. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] The Life of Christ! And the life of any seed … Which, He was the Word Seed, brings the Seed to Life. You get it? If that—if that Life is laying in the Seed, and this baptism of the Holy Spirit comes upon It, it’s bound to bring that Seed Life. As I told you, here at Phoenix, not long ago. I was talking to Brother John Sharrit. I was out there, and he showed me a tree, a citrus. He—he raised a lot of citrus fruit. And he showed me one tree, it had eight or nine different kinds of fruit on it. And I said, “Brother Sharrit, what kind of tree is that?” Said, “An orange tree.” I said, “Why is the lemon, and the tangerine, and tangelo, and grapefruit?” He said, “It’s all citrus fruit. They’re grafted.” “Oh,” I said, “I see. Now, next year, it’ll all have oranges. Be … ” “Oh, no. Each tree will bear its own. Each limb will bear its own fruit.” Many of you fruit growers know that, here in this citrus valley. It’ll bear its own. You put a lemon branch in an orange tree, it’ll bear lemons, ’cause it’s the nature of a citrus fruit. Yet, it won’t bear the original fruit. And that’s what we’ve done. We’ve grafted in, taken in with creeds, and so forth, and grafted in each, Here. How can the Methodists bring forth anything but a Methodist child? How can any denomination bring forth anything but a denominational child? But if that tree ever puts out an original branch, it’ll bring forth oranges. And then if God ever does anything in the Church, it’ll be original, back with the Word again. Exactly. It has to be, ’cause the Life is in the Tree, and It bears Its own kind. Now, when we find out, now, there’s that big church has moved down, through the ages, bearing its fruit. And as the limbs quit, they prune them off. In Saint John 15, never pruned the Vine out, now. He took the branches off, cut them out, because they wasn’t bearing any fruit. And—and we … Jesus wants fruit of, for Hisself. His Wife must bring forth the kind of a children that He is. Then, if it don’t bring forth children, Bride children, Word children, then it’s the denominational child. Then, her first love, for the world and denomination, she’s gone back to that. And it can’t bring forth a real, genuine, born-again Christian, ’cause there’s nothing there to bring It forth. Just like if you take a lemon branch and stick it in there, it’ll bring a lemon, but it can’t bring a orange, because it wasn’t there at the beginning. But it was ordained at the beginning, foreknowledge of God, predestinated and born, it has to bring forth an orange. It can’t bring nothing else. That’s the way with the Church of the living God, when the hour comes. Everybody … You let God start to do something, everybody has got the ball and gone. See? It’s always been that way. I was reading in history, of Martin Luther, here not long ago. Said, “The … It wasn’t so hard to believe that Martin Luther could protest the Catholic church and get by with it. But,” said, “the strange thing, that he could hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed his revival, and still stay straight on his justification.” See? Just everything, impersonations and everything, followed him. Look at Mrs. Semple McPherson, Aimee Semple McPherson, that had this temple over here. Every lady preacher had them wings, and packed the Bible the same way, just—just carnal impersonations! They can’t be original. That’s the way the churches can’t be. You let one church get something another in the city, the other church can’t stand it. They get it. See? They’re not original any more. God’s Word is original. It’s the Word, and It has to bring forth Its kind; Its kind in Its season, elected, predestinated by the Father, God. Now how do we get in this Church? “By one Spirit we are all baptized into this one Body, Body of Christ,” which is the Bride, the Word. “Baptized in there by the Holy Spirit.” Now let’s notice whether we’re in the last age, or not. Now we find out, if we turn back in Genesis, about the, oh, about the 5th chapter, you can also turn to Luke and find out, that Enoch was the seventh from Noah. Enoch. There catches the serpent’s seed. For, if Cain was Abel’s son, then he was the eighth. See? But nowhere in the Bible it said that Cain was Abel’s son … or Cain—or Cain was Adam’s son. Because, that, the Bible said, “He was of that evil one.” And Adam wasn’t the evil one. See? “He was of the evil one.” Now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah, which was a type of the church ages. Now, all of the rest of the six men, before him, died, but Enoch was translated. Enoch was raptured, the seventh, showing that it’s the seventh church age that takes the Rapture. Now, there’s no doubt, we’re in the seventh church age. We all know it. Now, it’s the seventh church age that takes the Rapture. All of the other six died. But Enoch was translated, because, “He was not found. God took him.” But Enoch, raptured, was a type of all of the rest of them dying. But the—the end-time Bride will be called out of the … The rapturing, without death, will be called out of the seventh church age, which we are now bearing record of that age. Oh, my! Let’s dig in now, real deep. See? Now, here, also, a type of the seven church ages, which, in Revelation 10:7, that the great mystery of the Book was to be unfolded by the seventh angel’s Message. Now, there’s a Messenger above, always, and a messenger on earth. The English word angel means “a messenger.” And in the seventh angel’s Message, while he was making his proclaiming, his ministry, “then when he begin to sound forth his ministry,” not when he started out. Jesus, when He started out, He started healing the sick and afflicted. “Oh, that great Rabbi! He’s a Prophet.” Everybody wanted Him in his church. But when He set down one day, and said, “I and My Father are One,” that was different. That was different. “And except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.” “Why, He’s a vampire!” See? See? That was different. He didn’t explain it. They had already seen the manifestation, the vindication of the Word of God for His age, made real and proved to them that He was that Messenger of that age. And He didn’t have to explain nothing. Those disciples might not have been able to explain It. But they believed It, whether they could explain It or not. They set right still and believed It. How could they tell if they was going to eat His flesh and drink His Blood? Why, it was impossible for them to do it. But they believed It, because they were ordained. Jesus said He “chose them before the foundation of the world.” See? They believed it. Whether they could explain it, or not, they still believed It. Now watch, now, in the seventh church age, “When the seventh angel begins to sound, the mysteries of God was to be made known right there,” the Seals. That, the reformers that … been they had time. Luther didn’t live long enough, neither did Wesley. The ages didn’t live long enough, them reformers. They had their message of that day, and the people grasped it and denominated it. And what is it? You can never beat nature. Nature always testifies. God runs in continuity with nature. It has to. Like the sun. The sun rise in the morning, it’s a little baby born. It’s weak, ain’t got much heat to it. Ten o’clock, it’s coming out of high school. Middle the day, it’s entering into life. Three o’clock in the afternoon, it’s getting old. Five o’clock, it’s dying. Old and weak again, going back to the grave. Is that the end of it? It rises again, the next morning. See? Look at the trees, how they put forth their leaves, everything that they do. Now we find out, the leaves drop off the tree, go back. What? The life goes down to the root of the tree. Is that the end of it? Comes back next spring, with new life. Now watch the churches, how it’s done the same thing in the reformation. It come up. That corn of wheat fell in the ground and died, under the dark-age persecution. It went into the ground. It had to die. Any man, spiritual, can see that. That, lest that seed dies and rot, it abides alone. And it had to go into ground, under the dark age. It laid there, rotted. And come forth in two little blades of the Lutheran church. Out of the Lutheran church, brought off more blades, Zwingli and so forth. From that come on up into the tassel, which was John Wesley, the great missionary age. It dropped back. Out of there come that deceiving age, that Pentecostal age. That corn of wheat, that … Anybody ever, here, ever raise any wheat? You look at that wheat when you look at it. When you go out there, say, “I’ve got wheat.” You look like you got a wheat there. Open it up real close and watch. You haven’t got no wheat at all. You got a shuck. Didn’t Jesus warn us that, in Matthew 24:22 … -four? “In the last days, that, the two spirits would be so close together, it would deceive the elected wheat Itself if it was possible.” See? Now watch. It’s a carrier. Now, the Life that come up through Luther was what made Wesley. The Life that come out of Wesley is what made Pentecost. The Life that comes out of Pentecost makes the wheat. But they are carriers. See? The real Life goes through there. The Message goes through, but It’s heading on up into the wheat. That’s the reason the wheat come up and brings the whole thing in the Rapture, up here at the top. The Bride, Itself, comes out of each age. But the denominational stalk dies, dries up and dies. Have you noticed, this last days, how it’s begin to pull away now? When that wheat begins to grow, then the—the shuck begins to get away from It. Look back in that little wheat when you look at it. Pull it open like this, and look into it and see. You got a little bud of wheat back there. You have to take a thirty-power scope to look into it, to see the little bud of wheat back there. See? It’s way back in there, but It starts growing. Now, that shuck has to be there, to shelter That, to give It a chance to get out. But then when It begins to grow and the Message begins to spread, then the shuck pulls away from It. And the Life goes right out of that shuck, right into the wheat. Goes on! That’s the way each age done. It just—it just can’t beat nature. It’s … That’s God’s continuity, the way He does things. And now that’s the age that we’re living in right now, the seventh church age. Now, it’s all to be manifested in the grain of wheat at the end, another come back. Now, if you take Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse, He said, “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man begins to reveal Himself.” What is reveal? Make His revelation of what He is in this day. Reveal, out to the people, the Word that’s made known for the day. Reveal, to the people, by the manifestation of Holy Spirit making that Jesus live among us. And, remember, He was represented there in a man. A man! He said, “As it was … ” Now, He read same Bible we read, Genesis. Now, we notice in that Genesis chapter there, when Jesus was speaking about it. We find there, that, in that, with His back turned to that tent, and Sarah in the tent. He said, He asked a question. And she didn’t believe that what was going to happen could happen. He said, “Now, Abraham, I’m going to visit you according to the time of life.” See? And Sarah, in the tent, laughed about it. He said, “Why did Sarah laugh, in the tent, saying, ‘How can these things be?’” Jesus promised. And That was Him. Abraham called Him, “Elohim,” the Almighty. That was Him. Now, the Bible predicts that it will return again in the last days. Jesus said so. “And when you see these things begin to come to pass,” just remember, when this starts to taking place like that then, that, “you know that the time is nigh at the door.” Look at the world itself. Look at the world, Sodom, if there ever was a Sodom. Look at the people perverted in such a perverting. Their minds are perverted. They don’t know what common decency is. Look at the outlaw … [Blank spot on tape — Ed.]  … sexuals and everything. And look at our women, what a rampage it’s made. Look what a rampage of indecency, immoral amongst our women. And not only our … You say, “That’s Methodists.” That’s Pentecostals, too. It’s the whole thing. Look at our men. They hang, instead of the Word of God, in some little tradition of denomination. They hang onto it, instead of coming out when they see God make Hisself known perfectly. The reason, they’re blind. They can’t see It. They never will see It. Now watch what takes place here in this, while we hurry. I think that lady wants us to leave. I seen her motion her hand, something another about she wants us to get out, so we better hurry. So now notice Enoch, the type of the Church. Here he’s also typed in the seventh church age. Can you think of that? The seventh church age! Notice. “At the sounding of … ” How many believes there’s been seven messengers for the seven chur- … Oh, we all believe it, if we believe the Bible. If we don’t believe the Bible, course, see, we don’t believe it. But, there has been. Now we’re living in the seventh church age. And when the Bible said that, this seventh church age, “When the messenger of the seventh church age begins to sound his Message, that the mysteries of all the things that’s been twisted up, down through the age, would be revealed in that time.” Here we see it, the Son of man coming among His people and doing just exactly, confirming His Message as He said He would do. Here we find it, in this last age now. And the seven watches, like the seven watch, of one come. He didn’t come the first watch, second, third, fourth, but come in the seventh watch. That was Enoch, the seventh, which was translated. And Noah, being a type of the remnant of Jews, is to be carried over. Now, in the Bible times, talking about the watches. And nights were not divided into hours, in the Bible time. Now listen closely. Cause, I’ll hurry now, ’cause they want the room. No. The Bible was not divided, or—or … The night was not divided in hours, in the Bible time. It was divided in watches. There was three watches. Now, the first watch started at from nine until twelve. The second watch started from twelve to three. And the third watch of the night was counted from three to six. Now we got three, three three’s, which is a nine, imperfect number. Then we come back to the seven for the Rapture, which will take place, I believe, between six and seven o’clock … or six and nine o’clock, some morning. “For the trumpet of the Lord shall sound.” On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise, And the glory of His resurrection share; When His chosen ones shall gather to their homes beyond the sky, When the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there. The word Rapture, in the Bible, is not even used at all. We just put that word there. The Bible says, “caught up; being caught up.” We read here in Second Thessalonians … Or, First Thessalonians, it is the order of this great Rapture that will take place in the last days. Listen to this here. We’re going to begin here with 13th verse.  … I would not have you … ignorant, brethren, concerning those which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others that have no hope. For if we believe … Christ died and rose again, even so them … which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For we say this unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent … (That word prevent means to “hinder.”) … those that are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend … Now listen close.  … the Lord himself shall descend from the heavens with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and … the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: … Now I want you to notice a great thing taking place here now. Don’t miss this. See? Now notice. The Word says here, in Second Thessalonians, that there is three things. Notice. From the 13th to the 16th verse, there is three things that has to happen before the Lord Himself appears. Quickly now, so we can close. See? The first thing happens … Notice: a shout, a voice, a trumpet. Let’s read It now and see if that’s right. See? For the Lord himself (16th verse) shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and … the trump of God: … Three things happens. A voice … A shout, a voice, a trumpet, has to happen before Jesus appears. Now, a shout … Jesus does all three of them when He’s—He’s—He’s—He’s descending. A shout, what is the shout? It’s the Message going forth, first, the living Bread of Life bringing forth the Bride. Now, God has a way of doing things. And He never changes His policy. He never changes His po- … He’s the unchanging God. In Amos 3:7, He said, “He would do nothing on the earth until first He revealed it to His servants the prophets.” And just as certain as He promised it, He’ll do it. Now, we’ve come through the church ages. But we’re promised in the last days, according to Malachi 4, that there would be a return again, a prophet in the land. That’s right. Notice his nature, what he would be like. He’s alway … God uses that spirit five times: once in Elijah; in Elisha; in John the Baptist; call out the Church; and the remnant of the Jews. Five times, “grace,” J-e-s-u-s, f-a-i-t-h, and it’s the number of grace. See? All right. Now, remember, the Message is promised. And when all these mysteries has been all so bundled up by a bunch of ecclesiasties, it will take a—a direct prophet from God to reveal It. And that’s exactly what He promised to do. See? Now, remember, “The Word of the Lord comes to the prophet,” not the theologian. The prophet, he is a reflector of God’s Word. He can’t say nothing; he can’t say his own thoughts. He can only speak what God reveals. Even to the prophet Balaam when he was tried to be sold, sell his right, he said, “How can any prophet say anything but what God puts in his mouth?” It’s a thing that God does, that you can’t say nothing else. And you’re born that way. No more than you could … If you could say, “I—I—I can’t open my eyes,” when you’re looking. See? You can’t. You can’t reach your hand, when you can. See? You can’t be a dog when you’re a human. See? You’re just made thus. And God has always, too, in the ages, through Isaiah, Jeremiah and all, the Elijah, in the ages gone by. When the ecclesiastical group would get everything all mixed up, He would send a prophet, raise him up from nowhere. He belonged to none of their situations, and speak His Word. Called off a scene, and gone, just rugged men of the Truth of God. And it’s always the way you could tell him. He said, “If there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet … ” Now, prophets. There’s such a thing as “gift of prophecy” in the Church; but a prophet is predestinated and foreordained for the hour. See? Yes, sir. Now, if a prophecy goes forth, two or three has to set and judge whether that’s right or not, ’fore the church can receive it. But nobody set before a prophet, ’cause he was—he was absolutely the Word of God. He was that Word in his day. You seen God reflect. Now, God has promised to send us that again in the last days, to bring the Bride out of that ecclesiastical mess, in the only way it can be done. It’ll never be done; the church can’t receive Christ. We, the Pentecostals, we can’t carry this Message on in the condition the church is in today. How we going to carry out the end time in the condition they’re in today, when every one against the other, and everything else, and ecclesiastically? Oh, mercy! It’s a mess. It’s done gone in denominations. And any time … I ask any historian to—to—to say different. Every time that a message went forth in the earth, and when they organized it, it died right there. And Pentecost done the same thing that they all did, the Pentecost that come out. You, Assemblies of God, when your forefathers and mothers come out of them organizations back there, in the old General Council, shouted and praised God, and talked against those things. And you turn, “like a dog to its vomit, and a hog to its wallow,” and done the same thing that they did. And now so ecclesiastical, you shut up your bowels of compassion. You have to have a fellowship card before you can even associate with you, hardly. You, oneness, God given you a message like that, and instead of you going ahead, and just keeping humble and go ahead, you had to turn loose and organize your group. And where are you all at? The same bucket. That’s exact. And God’s Spirit, moving on. “I the Lord have plant It. I’ll water It, day and night. Lest some should … ” He ordained these things to be, and He must send This. The first thing comes, when He starts descending from the Heaven, there’s a shout. What is it? Is a Message, to get the people together. A Message comes forth, first. Now, lamp-trimming time, “Rise and trim your lamps.” What watch was that? The seventh, not the sixth. The seventh, “Behold, the Bridegroom cometh. Rise and trim your lamps.” And they did. Some of them found they didn’t even have any Oil in their lamp. See? But it’s lamp-trimming time. It’s Malachi-4 time. What He prom- … Is Luke 17. It’s—it’s Isa- … All those prophecy that It can perfectly set in order for this day, in the Scripture, we see it living right there. There’s no … See these things happen, my dear brother, sister. When, God in Heaven knows I could die on this platform right now. You—you just ought to walk around a while. It’s just … It’s tremendous, when you see God come from the Heaven, stand before groups of men, and stand there, declare Himself just as He ever did. And that’s the Truth, and this Bible open. See? Right. We’re here. And the denominational system is dead. It’s gone. It’ll never rise again. It’ll be burned. That’s what you do with the husk on the field. Flee from it. Get into Christ. Don’t say, “I belong to Methodist. I belong to Baptist. I belong to Pentecostal.” You get into Christ. If you’re in Christ, there’s not a Word written in Here but what you believe It. I don’t care what anybody else said. And then God makes that thing manifested. Cause, you, when He pours the Spirit upon the Word, what happens? Just like putting water on any other seed. It’ll live, and It’ll bring forth of Its kind. You say, “I got the baptism, the Holy Ghost.” That don’t mean that you’re saved, not by a long ways. Looky here. You are a triune being. You are. Inside this little fellow here is the soul, the next is the spirit, and next is the body. Now, you got five senses in this body, to contact your earthly home. They don’t contact the rest of it. You got five senses of the spirit, here: love and conscience, and so forth, of that. But in here is where you live. That’s what you are. Didn’t Jesus say, “The rain falls on the just and the unjust”? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] Put a cocklebur out here, and a wheat out there, and pour water on them, and keep them under fertilize and things like that, won’t they both live by the same water? [“Amen.”] Sure. Well, what is it? One of them will bear a cocklebur, ’cause that’s all he is. The cocklebur will raise his hands and shout just the same as the wheat. Don’t the Bible say, “In the last days, there shall come false Christs”? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] Not “false Jesus,” now. “False Christs,” anointed ones, falsely anointed to the Word; denominational anointed, but not to the Word. For, the Word will bear record of Itself. It don’t need nothing else. It’ll bear record to Itself. “And there will come false anointed ones.” You got my tape on that. And that anoi- … Oh, if you’d call one of them, say, “Oh, you, are you a Jesus?” “Oh, certainly not.” They wouldn’t stand for that. But when it comes to an “Oh, glory! I got the anointing!” And it’s the genuine anointing. Remember, Caiaphas had It, too, and prophesied. So did Balaam have It, and prophesied. But that don’t have nothing to do with this, inside. Unless that was God’s seed, His gene from the beginning, predestinated, you’re finished. I don’t care how much you shout, speak with tongues, run, shout. That has nothing to do with it. A cocklebur can count just as much as any the rest of them. I’ve seen heathens raise, and shout, and speak in tongues, and—and drink blood out of a human skull, and call on the devil. See? So you don’t … Any of them sensations and things, forget it. It’s your heart in that Word, and that’s Christ. Bring in there, and watch It make Itself known, just as It opens up like any other seed, and declares Itself for the age It’s living in. Luther could bring nothing but sprig. These others could bring these other things. We’re in the wheat age now. Luther’s genuine Luthers had to bring forth genuine Luther. Genuine pentecost had to bring genuine pentecost. That’s all. But we’re past that age, and going on. You know, the Catholic church, started out, the pentecostal? And if the Pentecostal church would stand two thousand years, it’d be in worse shape than what Catholic is now. That’s exactly. I say that to my brethren, my sisters, who I love. And God knows that. But remember, friends, I got to meet you yonder at the Judgment. And that may not be too long. I’ve got to bear record of what’s the Truth. When I went forth into the meetings with you, praying for the sick, it was fine. But, when I come with a Message! If any Message goes forth, it’s a true Message … If it’s the true, genuine miracles of God, and hangs right in that organization, you know it’s not of God, ’cause that thing is already declared. Jesus went forth and healed the sick, in order to catch their eyes, the people, then His Message. That’s right. It has to have something that God is going to introduce. He just … Divine healing, His miracles like that, just catch the eyes of the people. The main heart of It is the Message. There’s what is, what comes from in here. He’s trying to get the favor of the people, so they’ll set and listen to Him, see, for there’s some in there that’s ordained to Life. Some of the grain, wheat, fell on ground, the birds picked it up. And others fell amongst thorns. And some was, went on prepared ground, pre-prepared ground, and brought forth. Now, it’s the first thing, is the sounding. The first thing is a trumpet and a … or a voice … A shout; and then a voice; and then a trumpet. Shout: a messenger getting the people ready. The second is a voice of the resurrection: the same voice, that, a loud voice in Saint John 11:38-44, that called Lazarus from the grave. Getting the Bride together; and then the resurrection of the dead, see; to be caught up with It. Now watch the three things takes place. The next is what? Was a trumpet. A voice … A shout; a voice; a trumpet. Now, the third thing, is a trumpet. Which, always, at the Feast of Trumpets, is calling the people to the feast. And that’ll be the Bride’s Supper, the Lamb’s Supper with the Bride, in the sky. See? The first thing comes forth is His Message, calling the Bride together. The next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping Bride; the—the ones died, back in the other ages, they’re caught together. And the trumpet, the Feast in the heavens, in the sky. Why, that’s the thing that takes place, friends. We’re right there, ready now. The only thing, the Church coming out, has got to lay before the Son, to ripen. The great combine will come by, after while. The wheat will be burned, the stalks, but the grain will be gathered into Its garner. See? You’re not blind people. You’re—you’re sensible people. And if I stood here and said those things for prejudice? I say It because It’s Life, because I’m responsible to God for saying It. And I must say It, and my Message. All the time, knowing, back there under healing and so forth like that, was just to catch the people’s attention, knowing the Message would come. And here It is. And them Seven Seals opened, those mysteries, and showing those things is what’s happened. I didn’t know it. But there is men standing right here now, was standing right with me. When, you all heard me preach that sermon: Sirs, What Time Is It? That morning, exactly where It said It would be, there stood seven Angels standing right there, from the Heaven. And as They went up, and the whirlwind taking Them up there, we standing, watching as They went away, science took the picture of It, all the way across the nations, down into Mexico. And there, when I was watching, one day, when I started preach these Seven Church Ages. And I called Jack Moore, a great theologian. I said, “Jack, Who is this Person standing there? ‘There is One like the Son of man standing there, hair as white as wool.’” I said, “He was a young Man, how could He have hair as white as wool?” He said, “Brother Branham, that was His glorified body.” That didn’t ring the bell. But when I went in the room and started praying, He let me know what it was. See? I’ve always preached that He was Deity, not just a man. He was God manifested in the flesh: God, the attribute of God, of love; the great attributes that come down, displayed here on earth, of God. Jesus was God’s love, which built a body that Jehovah Himself lived in. He was the fulness of the Godhead bodily. What God was, He manifested through that body. That body had to die, so He could wash the Bride with His—with His—with His Blood. And notice, not only is the Bride washed, forgiven, but She is justified. See? Did you ever try the word justified, to see what it means? Now, for instance, if Brother Green heard that I had been drinking, I been doing bad things, then he found out that I didn’t do it. Then he come, say, “I forgive you, Brother Branham.” “You forgive me? I never done it. What you forgiving me about?” See? But if I’m guilty, then I can be forgiven; but I’m still not just, because I did it. But the word justified is “though you never done it, at all.” Justified! And then the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us so from sin, till it’s put in the Book of God’s forgetfulness. He’s the only One can do it. We can’t. We can forgive but not forget. I could forgive you, but I always remember you done these evil things. Then, you’re not just; you’re forgiven. But, in the sight of God, the Bride is justified. She never done it, in the first place. Amen. Standing there, married to the virtuous Son of God; never sinned, in the first place. Why? She was foreordained. She was trapped into this. And now when She heard the Truth and come forth, the Blood cleansed Her. And She stands there, virtuous. See? She, no sin on Her, at all. Therefore, the Message calls the Bride together, see, the shout. And the trumpet … The same One, He, with a loud voice, He screamed out with that shout and a voice, and woke Lazarus. With a loud voice He cried, “Lazarus, come forth.” See? And the voice wakes up—wakes up the sleeping Bride, the sleeping dead. And the trumpet, “with the sound of a trumpet.” And, when it does, it calls. Always, a trumpet called Israel to the Feast of the Trumpets. See? Which, was a pentecostal Feast, the great Feast in the sky; and the Feast of the Trumpets. And, now, a trumpet do announce a calling together, “Come to the Feast.” And now that is the—the Lamb’s Supper in the sky. Now watch. The assembling together; and the Bride; the Feast of the Trumpets, the Wedding Supper. We have seen it in types. Now watch just a moment before we close. Notice. We seen it in types. Now, if you want to read in Matthew 18:16, It said, “There is three that bear record,” see, in Saint … in First John 5:7, so forth. Three is always a witness. Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] It’s a verification, something that’s right. Three witnesses bear. “In the mouth of two or three witness, let every word be established.” Now notice. We’ve had three witnesses. Three is a witness. Now, we have already had three raptures in the Old Testament. Did you know that? As a witness. Now watch. Enoch was one; Elijah was the other one; and Jesus was the other one. Jesus, being the Keystone, now, He bare record. See? He was the Keystone between the Old and New Testament, ’cause He had to first die and then rapture. He died; come to life and walked around here with us; and then was raptured up. Because, He was the Keystone that tied the two together. After His resurrection and rapture … Look. After He did that, and proved that, the Old Testament there. We all know Enoch was translated. We know Elijah was taken up by a whirlwind, that right, in a chariot of Fire. And Jesus died, buried, rose up and lived here on earth, and then was raptured up, the Keystone. There is three, to bear record. Is that right? Now, there has been one rapture already passed. You know that? That, let’s see if we can’t read it, right quick. Let’s get Matthew, the 27th chapter. And let’s get about the 45th verse of the Matthew, the 27th chapter. Let’s see if we can’t get that right quick, and see if—if we can’t get just a little bit out of this, would help us, right quickly. 27:45, I believe, I got wrote down here. Let’s read. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth … And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabach- … ? which to say, … my God, why has thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood by, … heard it, and said, This man calls … Elias. And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. The rest said, … let us see whether Elias will come and save him. Jesus, when he had cried … with a loud voice, yielded up … “A loud voice.” Loud voice! Watch. When Jesus, dying, screamed with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks did rent; And the graves were opened; and many of the bodies … the saints that slept arose, And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. One rapture is passed. Three has happened in the Old Testament, of them prepared, who the Word of the Lord came to. See? The Word of the Lord came to Enoch. The Word of the Lord came to Elijah, His prophet. See? The Word of the Lord was Jesus. See? Watch in the Old Testament, them Old Testament saints now, when this rapture first taken place. Notice verse 50. His loud voice awakened the Old Testament saints just exactly like the loud voice wakened Jesus … or wakened Lazarus. See? The loud voice awakened. And the second is fulfilled in Second Thessalonians, the 4th chapter. Let’s just take a read, read it. We just read, a few minutes ago. See?  … I would not have you … ignorant, brethren, concerning those … asleep, that you sorrow not, even … That’s First Thessalonians 4:12 to 18. That, that will be the second Rapture. The second Rapture will be the catching away of the Bride. The Old Testament saints has gone into His Presence, paradise done away. And the Old Testament saints ascended up, at His loud voice, when He screamed and give up the ghost; because (why?) the Sacrifice, the propitiation of their sins, that they had waited on, believing that perfect Lamb was coming. They had offered the Sacrifice, the Lamb. And when He died and yielded up the ghost, He screamed with a loud voice, and the Old Testament saints awoke. Watch the shout and the voice over here, the same thing at His Coming. See? “Yielded up the ghost.” And when He did, the Sacrifice was perfect, and paradise emptied out. And the Old Testament saints came to the earth again, walked around on earth, and entered in with Him, at His rapture. David said, over there, “Lift up, ye everlasting gates, and be ye lifted up.” “He led captive captive, give gifts unto men,” and the Old Testament saints went in with Him. They said, “Who is this King of righteousness?” “The Lord of Glory, mighty in host.” Mighty host, here they come in, marching. “Jesus led captivity captive,” and here He comes, with the Old Testament saints. And went in the new gates up There, and said, “Lift up, ye everlasting gates, and be ye lifted up. And let the King of Glory come in.” The voice come from the inside, said, “Who is the King of Glory?” “The Lord mighty in battle.” The gates flew open. “And Jesus, a Conqueror, led captive captive,” them that had believed on Him, and the Word had come to them. There, the Old Testament saints laying in there, waiting, “He led captive captive; ascended on High,” took the Old Testament saints and went in. There is one Rapture, already passed. The next Rapture takes place is (Second Thessalonians) for the Church, the Bride to be resurrected, to be raptured into Glory. “We which are alive and remain,” that’s the bodies left on earth, “will not prevent or hinder them which are asleep. For the trumpet of God shall sound first, and the dead in Christ shall rise.” See? “And we which alive and remain shall caught up together with them.” Other day, I was standing on the street corner. And I—I was standing on … I was standing on the street corner and watching the Armistice Day parade, and when it went up, going up the street. I stood there with my little son, Joseph. There come, the first, was the old first war tanks come by, little old tanks. After that come the great Sherman tanks of the new war, and a great cannons with their muzzle blast, a—a muzzle break on them, so forth. After there, come the soldiers; the—the—the Gold Star mothers. And then there come a float with the … on down … Well, down there come a float, and on the front of it was a grave, “to the unknown soldier.” And there stood a—a soldier standing there, guard at the grave. There stood a marine on the other side, and a sailor on the other side. And there was a partition drawed. And on the other side set a Gold Star mother. She had lost her boy. There stood a young wife, with her head over on a table, crying. A little ragged boy setting sideways; and the tears running out of his face. He had lost his daddy. I thought, “What sadness! I stand here and look, see them, old, just a few of the soldiers left; marching down there, crippled and old, like that, with their uniforms, but proudly displaying them because they were Americans.” I thought, “Oh, my God!” One day, there will come a blast from Heaven, “And the dead in Christ shall rise first.” Them Old Testament saints back yonder, who are waiting, will blast forth and come out of there first, and go into the resurrection. We’ll drop right in line, going into the sky; these old mortal bodies changed and made like unto His Own glorious body. What a—what a parade that’ll be when it starts heavenward, some of these days, in that rapturing time that lays ahead, oh, proudly displaying the Blood of Jesus Christ upon their chests, the Message of God in the hour that they lived in. That’s the hour that we’re looking forward to, brother. Looky, just in closing now. The second resurrection, all … First one is past. The second one is at hand, right now, will come to hand now. Now, the third one is the two witnesses of Revelation 11:11 and 12. Which, these are the ones that turns back, with the Spirit of Christ, to witness to the Jews, like Joseph did to his brethren. And remember, “Their dead bodies laid in the street, for three days and a half. Then the spirit of life came into them, and they were raptured, taken up into Heaven.” There is your three raptures of the New Testament. Three raptures of the Old Testament; all of them past. Now we’re ready, waiting for the raptures, the Rapture of the saints. It’s been spoken, and so shall it be. When God says anything, “All heavens and earth will pass away, but that Word will never fail.” When God said, back there in Genesis 1, He said, “Let there be light.” It might have been hundreds of years before there was any light. He said, “Let there be a palm tree. Let there be a oak tree. Let there be a desert. Let there be a mountain. Let there be this.” He spoke it, you see. And as long as it went out of His mouth, in a Word, it has to be manifested. It has to be. When … Then one day, He called His people out. And He had spoke to a man named Moses, by a Pillar of Fire, a Light; Holy, Sacred Fire. And Moses wouldn’t … The people wouldn’t believe Moses, so He said, “Bring them out to this mountain.” That morning, the mountain was all full of Fire, and flashing and thunders like that. And the people said, “Don’t let God speak. Let Moses speak, see, lest we perish.” God said, “I’ll not speak to them no more like this, but I’ll raise them up a prophet. And I’ll speak through him, and what he says will come to pass. Then, you hear It, because I am—I am with him.” Now, He spoke that. He said that it would come to pass. Look at this prophet, Isaiah, standing there; a man, intelligent man, a man was thought of, well, by the king, ’cause he had lived with Uzziah. The king, which was a great man, tried to take a preacher’s place, one time, and went in, got smitten with leprosy. And that’s what I told the businessmen. Don’t never try to take a preacher’s place. No, sir. You stay right where you’re at. See? You do your work, what God put, told you to do. If you’re a finger, you can never be an ear. If you’re an ear, you’ll never be a nose, nose or eye. See? You stay in your position. You heard that Message, other day, on the broadcast: Trying To Do God A Service. David, anointed king. All the people shouting and screaming, “It was right.” But he never consulted God’s prophet. And a man died, and the whole thing was marred. Don’t try to do God a favor. You wait till it’s God’s term. Let it come in His way of doing it. “I’ll start this big thing. It’ll do this.” Be careful, brother. Now, David knowed better than that. Nathan was in the land, in that day. He wasn’t even consulted, at all. See? He consulted captains of hundreds and thousands. All the people shouted, and screamed, and danced. Instead of … They had all the religious motion, but it wasn’t in the line and order of God’s Word, and it failed. Anything else, is not in the line and order of God’s Word, will fail. Only God’s Word will stand forever. “Heavens and earth will pass away, but not My Word.” Notice Isaiah, that intelligent young man standing there. All at once, the Spirit hit him. He couldn’t say no different. He was a prophet. He said, “Behold, a virgin shall conceive.” “Unto us a Son is born; a Child is born, a Son is given. His Name shall be called Counsellor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God, Everlasting Father. The end of … His government shall be upon His shoulders. The end of the … There shall be no end to His reign.” How could that man intelligently say that a virgin would conceive? Everybody looked for it. It’s done been spoke. It was THUS SAITH THE LORD. It had to come to pass, ’cause it was God’s Word. The same as it was in Genesis, when He planted them seeds down beneath the sea, where “it was without form, and void; and water upon the deep.” See? It had to come to pass. And one day, eight hundred years later, the womb of a virgin conceived the Seed of God, a created Seed. She brought forth a Son. That same Son stood there, one day. He said, “Lazarus, come forth.” And a man that been dead four days, rotten, his nose fell in, stunk, he came forth. Said: Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, amen, when all that’s in the grave will hear the voice of the Son of God, So, it’s done been spoke. It has to happen like that. There’s going to be a Rapture. Oh, my! I remember, just my last Message in California, where I thought I’d never go back again, when I predicted, “Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean. THUS SAITH THE LORD.” It will. She is done. She is washed. She is finished. What hour? I don’t know when, but it will be sunk. Right after that, the earthquakes begin to jolt and bow. Remember, many of you men standing right there, that rock, that day when that Angel came down there. And that Light and Fire falling from the Heaven, around the rock where we were standing there. Rocks flang out of the mountains, and falling across there. She blasted three times, hard. I said, “Judgment will strike the West Coast.” Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk. Remember, that same God that said that, said, “Los Angeles is doomed.” And she is finished. I don’t know when. I can’t tell you. I didn’t know I said that. But this brother here, I believe it was … No. One of the Mosely’s, I believe, had me out on a street out there. I didn’t know what it was till I looked back. I looked back in Scripture. And Jesus said, “Capernaum, Capernaum, how oft … You that’s exalted yourself, rather, up into Heaven, shall be brought down into hell. For if the mighty works that been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it’d a stood today.” And about a hundred and fifty years from there, (Sodom had already, in the earth) then Capernaum is in the water, too, today. And that same Spirit of God that said all these things, and done all these things, It said there, “Oh, city, Capernaum, who called yourself by the name of the Angels, Los Angeles, how you’ve exalted yourself into heaven! The very root and seat of Satan, see, you’ve exalted yourself.” Preachers, it’s a graveyard for them. Good men go there and die like rats. What havoc! “You that call yourself by the name of the Angels; if the mighty works had been done in Sodom, that been done in you, it’d stood today. But your hour has come.” You watch and see. If it ain’t, I’m a false prophet. See? There she is. She’s laying there. I remember that night, ’fore I seen that, I seen the preview of the Bride. I stood there and seen a beautiful little lady, just correctly dressed, and things, marching this way. There was Somebody standing by me, in the vision. And I seen. They said, “The preview of the Bride.” I seen Her go by. They come on this side, and went around. I heard it coming up, the—the churches coming up from this other side. There come the Asian church. Oh, you talk about filth! Here come the European church. Oh, my! And then I heard a rock-and-roll coming, and it was Miss America, the church, and she didn’t even have on any clothes. She had papers, like newspapers, gray, hold in front her, dancing by rock-and-roll; Miss America, the church. I stood there in His Presence. I thought, “O God, as a minister, if that’s the best we could do? Oh! Oh!” You know how you feels. Then I thought, “God, hide me. If I could just get away from here. If all that we’ve done, and that’s what we have to produce, if that’s what?” And then when them women passed by, all doing all kinds of rocks and things, and short hair, and painted faces. And as they passed by like that, supposed to be virgins to Christ. And when she passed by like that, I turned my head, you know, with this holding in front of me. It was—it was disgraceful, the back of them. And there they was, going like that. And I turned my head, to weeping, like that. I said, “I—I couldn’t stand it in there. Him standing there, and me know that me, a minister of the Church, and that’s what I had produced for Him.” I said, “O God, I can’t look at it. Let me die. Let me—let me fade away,” and like that. And as soon as it went out, every time one of them would come, they’d go out to a certain place, then drop off. I’d just hear the sound of it as it went away. Then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers. I looked, and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was, all correctly dressed, their hair hanging way down on their back. Smooth, clean, marching like this, to the step of the Gospel. She was the Word. They looked like one out of every nation. I was looking at it as they passed by, and seen them pass by. Instead of going down, they started going up. I noticed one of them trying, two or three of them trying, getting out of line. I screamed, “Stay in line.” And the vision left me. And I was standing in the room, screaming, “Stay in line.” Line, That. Wonder, could it be already past? Could the Bride already be called? Is that what we’re going through today? She has to be molded and made into the image of Christ, and Christ is the Word. That’s the only thing. See? It’s in There, in the Word. It’s ju- … See? There cannot be one thing added. It can’t be a—a woman with a one hand like a man, and the other hand with a paw like a dog. It’s got to be exactly the Word of the Lord, like He is the Word. The Bride is a part of the Bridegroom. The woman is a part of her husband, ’cause she’s taken out of the husband. Eve was a part of Adam from his side. And so is the Bride, not taken from a denomination, but taken from the bosom of the Word of God for this day. The Rapture! The trumpet of the Lord shall sound, the dead in Christ shall rise, And the glory of His resurrection share; When the chosen ones shall gather to their Home beyond the sky. When the roll is called up yonder, let’s all try to be There, friends. God bless you. It’s been spoken. It has to come to pass. It will come to pass. And little … [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] People, no one wants to die. No one wants to—to be lost. Let me tell you. Whatever you do … I don’t care how well you go to church, and how loyal you are to church. That’s fine; nothing against that. You should go to church. You do that. Keep on going to church. But, whatever, just throw away your traditions, and move right on up into Christ. Cause, it’s going to sound one of these days, and you’re going to be caught with the mark of the beast on you, and not know what it is until it’s too late. That’s exactly right. God bless you. I’m sorry to have kept you. And remember. I’ve kept them too long here. That’s right. And the offering that you taken for me … Which, I did not ask you to do that, brother. That’s, my, that’s courtesy. Take that and pay this motel the—the overtime, ’cause I kept it. I just had a few things here. I got about eight or ten more pages on that Rapture there, but I—I just didn’t have time to give it. God bless you. Do you love the Lord Jesus? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] Let’s just stand still just a minute now, quietly, reverently, and remember what I’ve said. Remember, we’re in the last hours. These nations are breaking, Israel’s awakening, The signs that the Bible foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; “Return, O dispersed, to your own.” The day of redemption is near, Men’s hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up, your redemption is near. You know that? False prophets are lying. God’s Truth they’re denying. We know that all is true. Don’t we? [Blank spot on tape — Ed.] I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. How many really love Him. Raise your hand. Now, I want you, while we sing this again, shake hands with somebody near you. Say, “God bless you, pilgrim.” We are pilgrims. Aren’t we? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] Pilgrims and stranger. I love Him, That’s it, right across the table. I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. You want to make the Rapture? [Congregation says, “Amen.” — Ed.] How many is interested in making the Rapture? Say, “God, I want to make it, with all my heart.” Hold To God’s Unchanging Hand, you know the song? You know it, sister? Hold To God’s Unchanging Hand. I don’t know what … What’s it in, for that one? Huh? Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! You like that? When our journey is completed, If to God you have been true, Fair and bright your home in Glory, Your enraptured soul shall view! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! I want you to bow your head just a moment now. Covet not this world’s vain riches, That so rapidly decay, Seek to gain the Heavenly treasure, They will never pass away! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Hold to God’s unchanging hand! Build your hopes on things Eternal, Hold to God’s unchanging hand! With your heads bowed, and this in mind, knowing that we’re bowing our heads to the dust from which we were brought, someday we’ll return, knowing that you got a soul in there that has to answer to God. And if you feel that you’re not just ready for that Rapture, if It would come tonight, and you’d want to be remembered in prayer, just raise your hand. We have no place to make an altar call. Your altar is in your heart, anyhow. Raise your hand. God bless you, you, you. My! “Feel that I’m not ready, Brother Branham. I—I, really, I—I—I want to be a Christian. I’ve tried to be, but there’s always something missing. I—I know that I—I’m not just where I should be.” “Have mercy, God. I raise my hand. Be merciful to me.” Now, some twenty or thirty hands has been up, already, in this little group. More is going up. Dear God, You know what’s behind that hand, down there under the heart. I pray, dear God. There’s only one thing I’m responsible for, that’s, to tell the Truth. And, dear God, they want to be saved. They want to, really. They—they don’t want this something that’s just some emotion, some work up, some denominational system, some creed, some dogma that’s been added. They understand, Father, that it takes the pure, unadulterated Word of God. Everything else will pass away, even heavens and earth, but It won’t. And if we be that Word, the earth will pass from beneath us, but we can never pass away, because we are that Word, the Bride of the Groom. I pray for each one, that You’ll grant to them, Father, is my sincere prayer. And excuse me, Father, for being so nervous tonight, jumping up here late, and—and being shaky, and saying words broke up and cut up. Somehow another, great Holy Spirit, splice them together in Your Own Divine way, and deliver them to the hearts of the people, from my heart, and the motive and the objective that in my heart I have towards You. Won’t You, Lord? And save which can be saved. Draw to You, Lord. And may we be ready for that rapturing hour that’s soon at hand. For I ask it in Jesus’ Name. Amen. God bless you. Now, the chairman of the—of the convention. 
To Brother Boone and the congregation, this is certainly a great privilege for me to be back in San Bernardino again. This place holds many great memories of the days gone by. And to hear that, the visit here, and still have living influence, why, it certainly makes you feel glad that the Lord directed us this a way, years ago. I was just setting out there in the parking lot, just now, trying to remember of one of the events that taken place. There was a Mrs. Isaacson had been my interpreter in Finland, on a Finnish campaign, and she came to the car when I was just leaving. And she said, “Your voice of Finland.” And I just wonder if Mrs. Isaacson lives around here. I didn’t know. She wouldn’t happen to be present tonight, I suppose? Mrs. May Isaacson, and she’s from Finland. Then another outstanding thing that brought to my memories, was a little waitress in a restaurant that I eat, somewhere near, they call the Antlers Hotel. I believe that’s right, now. And the little lady had … I was praying with her. She had … She, nice little lady, but she wasn’t a Christian. I invited her to the meeting. And she had lost a baby, and I believe that her husband, they was separated. And we was praying that she would make up with her husband, or they would make up, together. So, I just wonder if that little lady could be present. See? The … And then another event taken place, was a little baby that was brought from somewhere, about a day’s drive. And it had died, and was laying in the mother’s arms. And was brought back to life. Is that … Was that person present here? And it come, I believe, from the state up in this way, around, was above here. And the little mother had drove all night long, and the father, and the little mother setting there, sadly, holding her little, dead-form baby. And I thought, “Such faith!” If I was the biggest hypocrite in the world, God would have honored that mother’s faith. Holding the little baby in my hands, like that, praying. Got warm, it begin moving, opened its little eyes. I hand it back to the mother. So, they was from somewhere. I do not think they were Pentecostal, though. They were just … I believe it was just some church, that from … I don’t know even if they was Christians, or not. Never asked them. I was just so elated about the little baby being brought to life again. Since then, Brother Boone, much water has went down the river. But we’re still serving the same God Who remains the same yesterday, today, and forever. Just looking around, seeing Brother Leroy Kopp setting here. It’s the first time I seen him for a long time. [A brother says, “He’s Paul Kopp here.”] Paul. That’s right. Leroy is your father. That’s right. [“And he’s in Russia, tonight, so pray for him.”] Oh, my! Russia. Well, that’s, I know, this gallant soldier there, he’s there on the business of the King. [“Right.”] So, I’m certainly happy to be here and to hear this young minister saying he was inspired by the ministry that we had while we were here. Such a great thrill that is! And I am trusting now, that, knowing we got … People are standing, and we won’t keep too long. We remember those great healing services. Then, I understand that there is a brother here in the neighborhood, somewhere, holding a healing campaign, a Brother Leroy Jenkins. I believe that’s right. And so I’m very thankful, trusting that the Lord is blessing him and giving him a great, great service. It … My, I felt really honored, tonight, to come into a church like this. I always feel better in a church than I do in those auditoriums. There’s nothing against the auditorium. But, you know, I … It may be a superstition, or I just … Seems to me like a truth. See? They … You go into those auditoriums where there’s fights, wrestles, burlesque, everything else going on, evil spirits seems to hang around them places. Now, that may seem a superstition, but it isn’t so. But when you come into a church, you … usually, certainly a spiritual congregation, it seems like, that is, you feel more at liberty, like there’s something. The Presence of God is there. You know, it seems to be different. I don’t know what effect the building has, but it’s where the people are congregated. Course, the same people are at the other place, but on those evil grounds. May be just me thinking that way. But, anyhow, I’m glad to be here tonight. And now we want to not keep you too long, ’cause a standing audience. And we are going, tomorrow night, at some other place here. I don’t even know where it’s at. It’s near here. [A brother says, “Orange Show Auditorium.”] Where? [“Orange Show Auditorium.”] Orange Show Auditorium, for the services tomorrow night. I … This is between, I’m speaking on a tour for the businessmen’s Full Gospel Business Men’s group. Which, I’ve had the privilege of speaking around the world, for them. And so in there, a very dear friend invited us over here, and we’re glad to be in the assembly tonight. Now, before we open the Bible … Now, anybody that’s got physical strength can open It in this manner. See? But it takes the Holy Spirit to open the Word for us, open our understanding and reveal the Scriptures. I believe in the Bible. I believe that It’s God’s Word. And I believe that the earth, or the peoples of the earth, will be judged someday by this Word. Now, that may seem strange. Now, there’s many different with that idea. I was talking to a very loyal friend of mine, not long ago, who is Catholic. And he said, “God will judge the world by the Catholic church.” If that’s so, which Catholic church? See? So, if He judges it by the Methodist, then what about the Baptist? See? If He judges it by one, the other one is lost. So, there’s too much confusion there. But we have to go to It, to find our true statement, and the Bible says that God will judge the world by Jesus Christ. And He is the Word. Saint John 1, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” And Hebrews 13:8 said, “He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever.” And I believe that to be the Truth. Now, I believe that in … God, in the beginning, being the infinite God; He is finite and … or infinite, rather. We’re the finite. His mind is so much greater, and we, in our little finite mind, cannot understand His great, infinite wisdom. But therefore, when He speaks anything, it may seem very strange to us, to hear Him say a certain thing in the Scripture, but it’s got to happen. I believe that His Words will never pass away. Therefore, I believe that God, knowing that we in our little finite mind could not interpret His great mind, He interprets His Own Word. He doesn’t need any interpreter. He interprets His Own Word, by vindicating that Word in Its season. I believe that, God, in the beginning, that Noah was the Word for that day, for His Message. Now, along come, after that, come Moses. Now, Moses could not have taken Noah’s Word. He could not build a ship and floated them out of Egypt, down the Nile River, or to the promised land, or so forth. His message didn’t work in Noah’s day; that was the part of God’s Word that was vindicated to be Truth by Moses. Neither could Jesus have had Moses’ Word. And the … Luther could have not maintained the word of the Catholic church. Wesley, he could not maintain Luther’s Word. And the Pentecostal, they could not take the Methodist Word. They … See? The Church is growing. Each age, it’s lotted in the Scripture here. So, God, through the Holy Spirit, reveals His Word, by manifesting It and vindicating It, Hisself, showing that It’s His Word being brought to pass in the day that It’s promised. Jesus said that. He said, “If you can’t believe Me, believe the works that I do,” for they testify of Who He was, see, if anyone would have knowed the Scripture. Now, He come so oddly, so strange, that the people didn’t want to believe Him, because, “He, being a Man, was making Himself God.” So, He was God, in form. “God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself.” “And no man can do these works without God be with him,” as we know Nicodemus said that. That, the Sanhedrin believed that. Now, we know that, that Word. If they would have known the Word! He said, “If you’d have knowed Moses, you’d have knowed Me, because Moses wrote of Me.” And we look. If they had looked back in the Scripture, see what the Messiah was supposed to do, then they’d have knowed Him by the vindication, that, “God, through Christ, was reconciling the world to Himself,” and bringing to pass all the promises that was of the Messiah, that He was to do. Jesus bore record of that Word, making that Word live for that day. And I believe that’s the same thing we live in today: God bearing record of His Word, by vindicating what He said He would do. Now, we know that this is the day of salvation, where God is calling men from the world, from a life of sin, unto a life of service. And in the day that God has poured out His Spirit from on High, great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day. This is the … when the former and latter rain are falling, together. And we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders. Which, in many great denominations, This is turned down. But I’m very thankful for these open doors that I’ve had, to go into, and the inspiration it’s give to young men like your pastor here. That’s caused them … As I’m beginning to get old, and know that my days are numbered, and know now that these young men can take this Message and sweep It on to the Coming of the Lord, if He doesn’t come in my generation. Which, I’m hoping to see Him. I look daily for Him, watch, keeping myself prepared for that hour. Now let us speak to the Author before we read His Book, as we bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we are grateful to Thee, to be alive tonight, to return back to this great city. Setting here in this panoramic here of the mountains, looking up and seeing the snow, and the orange blossoms blooming, at the same time, what a magnificent world You’ve give us to live in! And how that we see that man has disturbed and acted in this world, it makes us ashamed of ourself, Father. We are here, tonight, to try to put forth our efforts, to try to cause men to see this great thing that God has done, and know that there’s something greater just beyond. May we look to that, tonight, Father, as we turn in to Your Word and read. We can read It, Father, but let the Holy Spirit reveal It to us through the revelation. For we ask it in Jesus’ Name. Amen. Now, you that like to perhaps take notes, and to read the Scripture with the minister, as usually they read It. And it used to be, when I … years ago, I didn’t have to write down my Scriptures, and so forth. But I’ve got a little older since then. See? I just passed twenty-five, just recently, twenty-five years ago. So, it makes it a little bad. But I’m still trying to hold on to everything that I know to do in His Word, until He calls me. Now, let us turn to Saint John the 14th chapter, very familiar Scripture that we want to read tonight, to draw from This a context, the Lord willing. Nearly all knows this. It seems to be, many times, it’s used in funeral services. There ever was a time that I’d like to preach a funeral service, it’d be to this world. Let it die and be born again. Saint John 14:1 through 7, I believe, I have marked down here. Let not your hearts be troubled: if you’ve believed in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house is many mansions: … it were not so, I would have told you. I go and prepare a place for you.  … if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  … where I go you know, and the way you know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know … where thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from henceforth you know him, and have seen him. May the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Word. And we’ll refer to It again, in the times as we go on, while we want to just speak a little lesson to the Church. Last evening, I was in Yuma; Arizona, where my home now. I … When I was here before I lived in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Now I been in Arizona, by a vision sending me there, a few years ago. And we resident there now. I don’t have any church there. Brother Green, our brother here with us, has established a tabernacle where the … one of the Assemblies of God, a church, downtown assemblies. They’ve merged, and I think they all went in with Brother Brock and with Brother Gilmore, left this church open. And Brother Pearry Green, from Texas, moved in and took the place, which is associate with us. We’re glad to know that Brother Green has reopened this church that was closed. And last night, speaking over in Yuma for the Christian Business Men, I spoke on the subject of The Rapture. Now, that might been a strange subject to speak among, at a banquet, but most everyone there was Christians. And that’s the way it is on these campaigns like this, or in a church. I could say now, “How many of you is Christians?” Probably every hand would go up. You’re a Christian. And so, if we’re Christians, I think we ought to be kindly notified ahead. We don’t have to just guess at it. We’re notified what our destination will be. And I want to speak on that tonight. And the subject is going to be: Things That Are To Be. And now, speaking last night on The Rapture, so tonight, I want to speak on this subject, that I might tie it together with last night’s Message. Now, there is going to be a Rapture, we know that. That’s in the future, to be. Now, Jesus here is speaking, about, He’s gone ahead to prepare a place for us. “Let not your hearts be troubled.” Now, He was talking to Jews. Said, “Now, you believed in God, believe also in Me. As you have believed in God, believe in Me, because I am the Son of God.” See? “And, God,” in other words, “I and My Father are One. My Father is dwelling in Me. And what you see do, I’m doing, it’s not Me. It’s My Father that dwelleth in Me. He doeth the works.” “God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself.” It was easy for those Jews who had been taught, through generations, to believe that there was a great supernatural God. But to think that that God had come down and was manifesting Himself through the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, God tabernacled in a body of flesh, that was a little too much for them to understand. But He said, “Now, as you have believed in God, believe also in Me. For in My Father’s house are many mansions, and I go to prepare a place for you.” Jesus’ life was fixing to end, here on earth. He had showed the people, and proved to them, that He was Jehovah manifested in flesh, by the great signs and wonders, and the reference of the Bible that He had referred to, to Himself. And He proved that He was God, manifested. Now He said, “When you see My life ending, it’s ending for a purpose. And I’m going away, to prepare a place for you; that where I am, there you may be also.” Jesus therefore is telling His disciples that this life is not ended in death. Now, saying this was a funeral text. Remember, we, death sets right before us, and we don’t know whether there may be some in this building tonight will not go out of here alive, in this physical life. That’s how uncertain it is. Five minutes from now, it could be that young, healthy, young people in this building can be a corpse in five minutes from now. That is true. And again, it could be, in five minutes from now, we’d every one be in Glory. We just don’t know. That’s in the hands of God. Jesus said He didn’t know, Hisself, when that time would be, but, “That was in the hands of the Father only.” Now, but, He was telling them, that, after death there is life. Because, “I go and prepare a place,” that is, to receive them, shows that there, He was speaking to them, that there was a life after this life is ended. And what a consolation that ought to give to all of us, to know that, after this life is over, there is a life, that we go into. And as you get older, that becomes more of a reality to you. As you begin to see the days of your life drawing close, then it begins to, you begin to pack up closer, getting ready for that great event. It’s now … It’s a continuing of this same life in another world, another place. Your birth here was preplanned. I guess you believe that. Every one of you knows that our birth was preplanned. Did you know that your being here never originated just at a myth or a thought? Everything was all preplanned by God, before the foundation of the world, that you would be here. The infinite God knowed. And to be infinite, He had to know every flea that ever would be in the earth, and how many times it would bat its eye. That’s infinite. See? You, our little minds, cannot fathom what infinite means. The infinite God, He knowed all things. Therefore, there’s nothing out of cater. If we know the Word of God, we know where we are living. We know the hour that we’re living in. We know what lays ahead. We see what we’ve passed. And the Book of God is the revelation of Jesus Christ; His works through the ages, that was up to the Book of Revelation, and then His promises that is to come. So, all of His promises are true. God cannot speak any Word without It being confirmed. Every Word that He says has to come to pass. Before the foundation of the world … Some people mix Genesis up, there, when he said, “God repeats Himself.” No. Just, you’re misunderstanding. See? God, at the beginning, He said, “Let there be. Let there be. Let there be.” The world was just dark, in a chaos. Even when He said, “Let there be light,” there might have been hundreds of years before light ever sprung in. But when He spoke it, it has to come to pass. It must be that way. See? And He spoke His Word. Them seeds was beneath the water. When He dried off the earth, then the seeds come up. What He says must come to pass. He said, through the prophets. I referred to it last evening. Like, we take Isaiah, he said, “A virgin shall conceive.” Who would think, of a man that was thought of among people, to say such a word as that, “A virgin shall conceive”? But because he … A prophet is a reflector of God. He is made so that he cannot speak his own words. It has to be God’s Words that he speaks. He’s just like a reflector, and he is God’s mouthpiece. And so, therefore, he said, “A virgin shall conceive.” He probably could not understand it, but God had spoke it through him. Because, He promised that, “He would do nothing until He revealed It to His servants the prophets.” Then, when he said that, it was eight hundred years before that ever come to pass. But it had to come to pass. Finally, those Words of God anchored in the womb of a virgin, and she conceived and brought forth Emmanuel. “Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given. His Name shall be called, ‘The Counselor,’ ‘The mighty God,’ ‘The Prince of Peace,’ ‘The everlasting Father.’” That had to be that way, because God had spoke it through the mouth of His prophets. And all the Words of God has to be fulfilled. Therefore, we know that Jesus has gone to prepare a place, to receive a people unto Himself. Who those people are, I hope it’s we are part of those people tonight. If it isn’t, my friend, God has made a way, a condition, that you can be included in that if you want to. You’re on free moral agency. You can act the way you wish to. But now notice, now, in this world that is to come. There is a world to come. Just like your birth here, I said, you was prepared. God knew you would be here. And now you know, even things that your parents done, now, people think that that isn’t visit from generation to generation, but it is. Over in the Book of Hebrews, I believe, about the 7th chapter, speaking, Paul there, the writers, I believe it was, was speaking on a great event that taken place with Abraham, that he paid tithes to Melchisedec, when he was returning from the slaughter of the king. And now he said, that, “Levi was in the loins of Abraham, when he met Melchisedec, coming from the slaughter of the kings.” And then he reckoned that to “Levi paying tithes, also, when he was in the loins of Abraham,” his great-great-grandfather. And He visits the sins of the people upon their children, from generation to generation, that won’t keep His Word. See? You were all pre-planned by God. Nothing happens by chance, with God. He knows all about it. It’s all pre-planned, planned for many generations back, so that you could be here tonight. Did you know that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Just think, that, you, at one time … I’ll repeat this again. You, at one time, was in your father, in the gene of your father. Now, he didn’t know you at that time, neither did you know him at that time. But, you see, then you were put in the bedding ground, in the womb of mother, through holy wedlock. And then you become a person expressed in the image like your father, then there’s fellowship. Now, the only way that you can be a son, a daughter of God, because you have to be the … have to have Eternal Life. And there’s only one form of Eternal Life, and that’s God’s Life. Only one form of Eternal Life, that was God. There, to be a son of God, you had to be in Him always. The gene of your Life, spiritual Life, tonight, was in God, the Father, before there was even a molecule. See? And you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of Life that was in God, as a son of God. Now you’re expressed, after His Word has come in you, to Light up this age. You are expressing God’s Life in you, because you are a son or a daughter of God. Therefore, you get what I mean? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] See? You are in … You are now made, you’re setting in this church, tonight, because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people, and this neighborhood where you associate. Wherever you are, God knew that you would be here, because you have to be one of His genes, or His attributes. You had to be. If you ever, if you’ve got Eternal Life, then It always was Eternal Life. And God, before there was a foundation, world, knew that you would be here. And when the Word, or the water, “the washing of the water of the Word” fell upon you, it was expressed in a being. Now you have fellowship with your Father, God, just as you have with your earthly father. See? You are citizens of the King; not citizens, but you are children, sons and daughters of the living God, if it be that the Eternal Life dwells in you. Now, then, if It was, Jesus was the fullness of God manifested. He was the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Therefore, when He came to the earth and was manifested in flesh, you were here in Him then, because He was the Word. “In the beginning was the Word; the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.” The Word was made flesh. Therefore, you walked with Him, when you were in Him, when He was on earth. You suffered with Him, and you died with Him. You was buried with Him. And now you are risen with Him, and manifested attributes of God, setting in Heavenly places; already raised, resurrected to new Life, and setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh, that means so much, now days, Church! That means so much to us, to see ourself positionally placed in Jesus Christ! Now, if we are those attributes of God, we cannot live by creeds. We cannot live by denominationalism. We must live by the Word, because the Bride is a part of the Bridegroom, like any wife is a part of her husband. Therefore, we must be that Word Bride. And what is that Word Bride? The manifestation of this hour, the Bride, not a creed or a denomination; but a living oracle of God, a living attribute of God, displaying to the world the attributes of God, in the formation of the Bride that’s to be expressed in this hour that we’re now living. Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express, because that that was in the beginning, the resurrection, like the corn of wheat that went into the earth. Now, we quote this again. You probably read the book, that German making fun of me, and said I was a fanatic of all the fanatics. He was absolutely against everything that’s called God, and even made fun of God. Said, “A God that could open the Red Sea and,” said, “take His people out; and set with His hands across His tummy, and let (through the dark ages) all those people die and suffer, those little children be eat by lions.” You see, the whole program, the whole Church, is built upon Divine revelation. Jesus said, in Saint Matthew, the 16th chapter, “Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you.” What was it? A revelation of Who He was. “And upon this Rock, I’ll build My Church, and the gates of hell can’t prevail against It.” See? The revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour; not what He was in another hour! What He was now, the Bible expresses. It’s growing in the Bride, to the full stature. Therefore, if the corn of wheat, of Christ, had to fall in the ground, so did the Bride have to fall in the ground, through the dark ages. Any grain that goes in the ground must die, or it can’t produce itself, reproduce itself. And the great Church that He established on the Day of Pentecost, by the sending of the Holy Ghost, had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt, into the earth in the dark age, to bring forth again in the age of Luther, and come on out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day. See? There’s no way … Therefore, the Bride, in the Rapture, will come forth. And there is all pre-planned by God, all backed up. From the beginning, He knowed every man, every place, who would set, all about it. It’s all pre-planned. God knew it would be here. And when … He made it that way, so that when we get there … He’s gone to prepare a place for us. And when we get there, it’ll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared, like this hour is prepared. Yes. His great foreknowledge tells Him all these things, by foreknowledge. He’s omnipresent because He’s omniscient; omniscient because He’s omnipresent. Therefore, by His foreknowledge … Now, He can’t be just like the wind over the earth, because He is a Being. He just isn’t a myth. He’s a Being. He dwells. He even dwells in a house. He dwells in a place called Heaven. And therefore, by His omni-, being omnipresent; being omniscient, knowing all things, then He is omnipresent because He knows all things. You, now, you grew from your birth, when you was born and presented into this world. God knew that you were going to be here in this earth, and you growed from birth to maturity. Things that seemed so strange to you, in your young womanhood, young boyhood, as children, now seems very real. You couldn’t understand it when you was a child. But now, as you become adult, you begin to understand and find out that everything was just set just right. And, you, it really means something to you now. So is it in your spiritual birth. You do things that you don’t understand, when you’re a little baby, come to the altar. You give your life to Christ. You do such strange things. You wonder why you did it. But after while, when you mature, as matured Christians, then you understand it. See? There’s something picks up. You see why you had to do it. Your spiritual birth! Your natural birth types your spiritual. How it fitted to you, in this life, as you grew, everything fitted right in, because you were made for that. Wasn’t it a strange thing, the night that you staggered into the mission, the tent meeting, or the little church somewhere on the corner, and something the preacher preached on, a certain subject, and you just fell right at the altar? See? See? God knew that, before the foundation of the world. See? It seemed strange to you, why you did it then. But now you understand; you knew what happened. It’s so fitting to you in this life, and will be also in the Life that is to come. This world and its life seems to advance as you mature. Everything seems to go right with you. I don’t believe in a … that a person just happened to be here by chance. Now just think, when you come to the world, everything had to be fore-prepared for you, or pre-prepared, rather, for you. I don’t hardly understand that how that we could think that a God that could prepare all these good things for us would not … we could not put trust in Him. That, if He brought us in this chaos that we’re in now, and prepared the good things of life for us here, how much more can we trust Him to prepare the things that is to come, see, the Eternal things! It seems, I say, very strange. And I do not think that Heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about. I believe that the Church has growed from that. To think, it used to be, a hundred years ago, or two, I think the old-timers used to think that everyone that died went up to Heaven and had a harp, and set up there on the clouds and played a harp. Now, they knowed that there was a place called Heaven. But, they, if that be so, all the musicians would have it on us, you see. But we … But it isn’t that kind of a place. It isn’t playing harps, at all. I believe, don’t believe the Bible teaches that. But that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the Word come into existence, or the opening of the Seven Seals, that’s promised to us in this age, that we then understand. I believe that Heaven is a real place, just the same as this is a real place, see, for God started us in our spiritual growth in this place. And I believe that Heaven is a place just as real as this, where we don’t set up there for Eternity and just set there on a cloud. We don’t just strum our harp, for all from here, ever. But we’re going to a real place where we’re going to do things, where we’re going to live. We’re going to work. We’re going to enjoy. We’re going to live. We’re going to Life, to a real Eternal Life. We’re going to a Heaven, a paradise. Just like Adam and Eve worked, and lived, and eat, and enjoyed, in the garden of Eden before sin came in, we’re on our road right back there again, right, right back. The first Adam, through sin, taken us out. The Second Adam, through righteousness, bring us back in again; justifies us and brings us back in. You people that take the tapes now, on the message of “justification,” I want you take it. And you do take the tapes, I want you to get that. I spoke on it, here some time ago. Look how your earthly parent, before you come here, before they knowed you was coming, made ready for your coming. Just think of that now, your earthly parents. Which, an earthly parent is only a type of a heavenly Parent. “If we know how to give good gifts to our children, how much more does your Heavenly Father know how to give good gifts to His children.” Jesus spoke these Words. See? They made ready your coming. They made a little crib, or got a little, some little booties, and little clothes, and so forth. They made ready, everything for you to arrive, prepared before you even come on the earth. Jesus has gone to make ready our coming there. Now notice. “In My Father’s House is many mansions.” Or, let us … I don’t mean to add to the Word, or take from It, because we’re not to do that. Revelation 22 said, “Whoever will add a word, or take a Word out of It.” But let me just make this, as not an additive, but just to bring out a point. “In My Father’s House is many kinds of mansions.” I don’t believe that when we get to Heaven that we will be, just everybody look just exactly alike. I don’t believe that all will be blondes, or brunettes, or little, or all big, or all giants. I believe that God is a God of variety. The world proves that. He’s got big mountains and little mountains. He’s got plains. He’s got deserts. He’s got different things, because He made it the way He wanted it. And He made the seasons; summer, winter, spring, autumn. He made the seasons. It shows He’s a God of variety. He made you in a variety. Some men are real blusterous; and some are real dogmatic; and others are fine; others are kind. And you just find all different kinds of people, and in His Kingdom. See? Look at Saint Peter, and judge him by Andrew. See? Andrew is that prayer warrior, just stayed on his knees all the time. And the apostle Peter was one of those firebrands that preached, and so forth. And Paul was more scholarly-like, more of the … like the prophet, or something, and set back. And, see, Moses wrote the first four Books of the Old. Which, he wrote the Old Testament. The rest of it was the laws, and kings, and psalms, and so forth, and what someone wrote of the prophets. But Moses wrote the laws, the first four Books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. And then Paul wrote the New Testament. That’s true. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John wrote the acts of what taken place, and so forth. But Paul separated law and grace, and put it into its place. See? He was the writer of the New Testament. He gave us the writings of the New Testament, setting the Word of God in order. Now notice, many, “many mansions,” many kinds of mansions. Like, many kinds of hills; like, many kinds of rivers, springs, lakes. They were here when you come here, first, because the kindness of your Heavenly Father placed them here. Because, some men likes mountains. Some people likes waters. Some likes deserts. So, you see, your coming, He knew your nature and what you would be, so He made it just the way that you could enjoy it. Oh! I think that’s a wonderful Father, see, know that He made it like this. I’m glad He made mountains. I like the mountains. I … And I like that. Where, the others, “Oh, I can’t stand … Oh, He must have emptied His mortar box out there.” Well, He emptied it out so I could enjoy it. You see? So then say, “I like the plains, where I can see a long ways.” Well, the two different natures, both of us Christians. But the Father knew that you would be here, and prepared everything for you before you got here. Amen. Your first coming, here, He had it ready for you when you got here. Isn’t that marvelous to think of what He done? Now, now, but remember, these are only temporal gifts, in type. “Now, we know that Moses, in building the tabernacle in the wilderness, or preparing it, he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in Heaven.” See? So, the earthly things only express what the Eternal things are. And if this earth that we live in today, being so great, as we love it; and love to live, and breathe the air, and see the flowers and things; if that, if this here is the expression, one that’s dying is only expressing one that’s Eternal. When you see a tree struggling, pulling, trying to live, that means there’s a tree somewhere that doesn’t have to do that. When you see a man here, struggling to live, somebody in a hospital, or on a sickbed, or in a accident, struggling, and the death rattle is in their throat, and pulling, and crying, and screaming for life, what does that mean? There’s a place, somewhere, there’s a body that doesn’t struggle and scream for that. See? It just doesn’t do it. Now, they are temporal gifts to us, these things, only expressing that there is One where it’s the Eternal One. That’s what Jesus has gone away to prepare, the Eternal One for us. Now, they only express there’s a greater of the same kind, ’cause these are a same kind. Now, remember, the Bible said, “If this earthly tabernacle of our dwelling, if it perish, be dissolved, we have one already waiting.” Just as the little baby, its little muscles, in the mother, are twisting and turning. And, but just … See? And you notice, you can take a woman, if she is ever so foul; but when she’s become a mother, a little while before that baby is born, there’s a kindness about the woman. Get around her, there’s always something, she’s more tender. Why? There’s a little angel spirit waiting to receive that natural body. Just as soon as it’s born, the breath of life comes into it. And God breathes it in there, and it becomes a living soul. Now, just as this baby is being born, then the spiritual body is there to receive it. And now, when this body is dropped here, in this earth, like the baby is dropped, also there is a immortal body waiting to receive the spirit back into itself again. Oh, what a great thing! We are now in Christ Jesus, (amen), babies, babes in Christ, children of God, waiting for the full deliverance, at the Coming of our Lord Jesus, the … to receive us up unto Hisself, when the body, this mortal, will take on immortality. The likeness, all the things that He did, expresses the things that are to come. Just as the body gives you here, just as this body, He gave you to live in, only expresses that there is one that is greater, yet, to come. See? “If we bear, or have borne the image of the earthly, we also shall bear the image of the Heavenly,” which holds no evils in this one that is to come. Now, this one does hold evil, sickness, death, sorrow. I’ve just expressed here, not long ago, preaching on The Transformation Of The Word Of God, of how that this body, it’s got the evil in it. And all this modern civilization that we live in is of the devil. You don’t believe that? The Bible says it is; this world, every government. We don’t want to believe that. But the Bible plainly states it, that every government, every kingdom of the earth, is owned by the devil and ruled by the devil. Jesus was taken by Satan, up, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world that was, would be, what more. And Satan claimed them, his, and Jesus never argued with him, because he is the god of this world. See? And he said, “I’ll give them to You if You’ll fall down and worship me.” See? He was trying to give them over to Jesus, without sacrifice. See? It was a bargain that he was going to make Him. But the world had sinned. So, the penalty of sin was death, and He had to die. That’s why God was manifested in flesh, so He could take death on Him, to pay the penalty. There’s nothing to come back. It’s not earmarked. It’s absolutely, freely paid. All the debt is paid. It belongs to Him now. And we are delegates of His Kingdom, assembled here together tonight, in the Name of Jesus Christ our King, setting in Heavenly places. Now, in this world that we live in, this education. I want to prove to you. Education, science, civilization, and all these things that we seemingly so enjoy today, is of Satan, and will perish. You say, “Brother Branham, civilization?” Yes, sir. This civilization come by Satan. Genesis 4 proves it. Cain’s son, see, started this civilization, building cities, and organs, and so forth. And civilization came by knowledge. Knowledge is what the devil sold Eve, in the garden of Eden, that caused her to cramp, transgress God’s commandment. So there will be a civilization in the world that we’re going to, but it won’t be this kind of a civilization, for in this civilization we have sickness, sorrow, lust, death, everything in this civilization, wrong. But in that civilization there will be none of these things. We won’t need science. Science is the perversion of the original, anyhow. See? You split a molecule, to split atoms and do so-and-so, to blow you up. You take gun powder, bang this, to kill something. You take the car. And take gasoline out of the earth, and the materials out of the earth, to loosen up the fibers, so it can blow up. And go down the road at ninety miles an hour, and kill somebody. See? Oh, so nervous, squeezing, hurry up; we got to pushing, taking. Oh! See? It’s all of the devil. The Kingdom of God will not have automobiles, airplanes, or any scientific achievements. No. It won’t have any education, at all. It’ll be an education so supreme to this, that this won’t even be thought of. See? Education, civilization, and all this, comes from Satan. Now, you say, “Brother Branham, why do you read, then?” See, just like, why do I wear clothes now? In the civilization that was to come, that was first, they didn’t need any clothes. They were veiled. They had no reason to wear clothes, ’cause they didn’t know they were naked. Now you … Now you find out, that, in now, then, that we know that we are naked, sin abides here, then we’ve got to wear clothes. But it wasn’t so at the beginning; there was no sin. See? Now, the same thing is in the way of civilization, altogether. We read. We write. We do this. But don’t never get adjusted to that. Don’t never make that your god, for that is the god of communism. See? It’s not of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is by faith; not what you can scientifically prove, but what you believe. I can’t scientifically prove you, tonight, in this building, that there is a God, but yet I know He’s here. But, by my faith, vindicates it. Abraham could not scientifically prove to you that he was going to have a baby to that woman, and her nearly a hundred years old. But his faith confirmed it. See? Didn’t need any scientific proof. Why, the … Why, the doctor would said, “The old man is crazy, out here saying he’s going to have a baby by that woman; him a hundred years old, and her ninety.” But, you see, God said so, so it don’t take science. It takes faith, to believe God’s Word, not science. So, our schools and things are a blow up. As, God never said, “Go forth and make schools,” or even, “have Bible schools.” You know that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] He said, “Preach the Word.” That’s exactly right. Our educational systems taken us farther away from God than anything I know of, that’s right, farther away from God. Not build schools, hospitals, and so forth; that was for the world and for that group. But, I ain’t got nothing against them; they play their parts, but that still is not that. We build a hospital, ever so good, and practice with the best medicine we got, and thousands die in it daily. But, oh, my, in the Kingdom of God, there is no death, there is no sorrow. Amen. There’s no need of these things of the world. But we’ve passed from this thing, into the realities of God; where we struggle so hard to try to find, through science. And more scientific we get, more death we bring on ourselves. We’re fighting a losing battle there, so turn loose of it. And by faith, believe Jesus Christ the Son of God, tonight, and accept Him. He is the One. What is science preparing for you? More death. That’s right. Sputniks and everything going up, and all these things, to scatter death and everything across the earth. Don’t look to that. Turn your head higher than that, towards Heaven. Look where Jesus sets, “On the right hand of God,” tonight, “ever living to make intercessions on our confession,” of what we believe, His Word to be the Truth. Now, we find, this life holds all kinds of evils, so therefore the life that is to come won’t have it. This one has lust, and sickness, death. Because, what is it? It’s not the house that He’s gone to prepare. This is a pesthouse. How many knows what a pesthouse is? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Sure. Well, that’s what you’re living in. A pesthouse is where they put all the diseased people. Well, that’s just what sin done to us, put us in an earthly pesthouse. Were you … They wouldn’t let anyone else come in the pesthouse, because there’s all kinds of germs flying around in there, and the people will take these germs and be sick, themself. And sin brought us into the devil’s pesthouse. Oh, but the other one is called, “My Father’s House.” “I’ll go and prepare a place for you. Take you out of this pesthouse and deliver you into My Father’s House.” Amen. There you are; take you out of this old earthly pesthouse. He’s gone to prepare a place, a perfect place where no evil exists, no sickness exists, no old age exists, no death exists. It’s a perfect place calling you to that perfection, and you have to be perfect to get there. The Bible said so. Jesus said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.” It’s a perfect Kingdom, so it must be a perfect people come. Because, you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God, and you must be a perfect Bride. So how can you do it through anything else but the perfect Word of God, which is, “The Waters of separation, that washes us from our sins”? Amen. That’s right. The Blood of Jesus Christ, think of It, the dripping, Bloody Word. Amen. The Blood, the Word of God bleeding Blood, to wash the Bride in. Amen. Yes, sir. She stands perfect, virgin, unadulterated. She never sinned, in the first place. Amen. She was trapped into it. See? There’s the Father’s House that He’s gone to prepare. This one come by sex, and from the fall, and must fall with the fall. No matter how much you patch the old thing up, she’s going to fall, anyhow. She’s done, because she’s doomed, because God said so. She is finished. God is going to destroy it. He said so. There’ll be a renovation of the whole thing. You believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] In the beginning, when the world had its birth, when God pulled back the water, first, off the earth, like He did the water from the mother’s womb, there was a world born. Yes. And peoples begin to live on it when God put them on there. And then they begin to sin. And it was baptized, by immersing, in the days of Noah. Then it was sanctified by the Blood of the Creator dropping upon it. And now that’s the way you come, through justification, to believe God. You were baptized unto repent, or, to, for the remission of your sins. You confessed your sins before God, and He forgave you for it. And you was baptized, to show that you had been, you had been forgiven; confessing to the people, and showing to the world, that you believe that Jesus Christ died for you. And you … He took your place, and now you stand in His place. He become you, that you might become Him. Then the sanctifying power of God cleansed all the habits out of your life. You used to smoke, drink, do things that wasn’t right, tell lies, everything. Then the sanctifying power of the Blood of Jesus Christ comes into your life and takes all the things away from you. If you happen to say something’s not wrong, quickly say, “Wait a minute. Pardon me. I didn’t mean to say it like that.” See? The devil got a trap setting there. But you got grace to come back, if you’re a real Christian, say, “I was wrong.” Yes. So, therefore, now, the … Now, the next thing you receive, was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire. Now, God, when this Millennium is over, God is going to give the world a baptism of fire. It’s going to blow the whole thing up. “The heavens and earth will be on fire.” Peter said so. And the thing will have a baptism of fire, renovation of the whole thing. And then there’ll be a new heavens and a new earth. That’s, when, where dwelleth righteousness. That’s where we are. We have become from mortal beings, from time beings, to Eternal beings. When the Word of God lit our souls, and we become sons and daughters of God, with the attributes, the gene of God in us, to be sons and daughters of the Father, God in Heaven, crying, “Abba, Father! My God, my God, in my Father’s House.” Now, this old world must fall, because it come through sex. And it come through disobedience, in the beginning. And we was born here through sex, through the fall, and it must go right back the same way, to the fall. But the one He is now preparing for you, cannot fall, because He is making it so. “I’ve gone … ” What if we just had to stay in this kind of a body? Aren’t you glad there’s such a thing as death? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Now isn’t that strange? But now, say, for instance … A few years ago, I was a little boy, and now I’m a middleaged man. I got a friend setting right there, Mr. Dauch, and he’s ninety-three years old, a few days ago. Look at him now. Forty or forty-five more years, that would be me. Now put another forty years on him. Where would you go? The only … I’m glad that there’s something to get us out of this pesthouse. There’s an open door, and it’s called death. Jesus stands in that door. Amen. He’ll guide me over the river. He’ll take me through that door. There’s a great door standing yonder, called death. And every time your heart beats, you’re one beat closer to it. And someday I must come to that door. You must come there. But when I come there, I don’t want to be a coward. I don’t want to scream and back off. I want to come to that door, wrap myself in the robes of His righteousness (not mine), His. By this I know, that, “I know Him in the power of His resurrection.” That, when He calls, I’ll come out from among the dead, to be with Him, out of this pesthouse. Wherever this body might fall, and wherever it might land, whatever it is, I’ll come out someday, because He promised It to me. And we believe it. Yes, sir. He’s making One that cannot fall. Notice how the expecting mother, on earth today, how the mother’s body craves for certain things. I’m speaking, I guess and hope, to all the adults that will understand. The mother, in the birth of the baby, if there’s something lacking in her body, she begins to crave certain thing. Look how dad … I remember we was raised, such a poor family, and we didn’t have hardly anything to eat when we were kids. Many of you suffered that same thing. So how that, when, before the babies would be born, mother would crave something. And dad would just pinch corners, everything, to get it for her. See? It’s her, the body, her body, the calcium and so forth of her body, and the vitamins that she needs. Junie is being made up, see, and he craves for things, foods for the coming child. And how, the parents, they try to get it so the baby will be born as perfectly and happy as possible. See how your parents will do that? When there’s something needed, the mother gives witness of it, see, her system is made up. You understand? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] That, how that when there’s something needed here, to the oncoming child, the mother begins to crave for that. Now, stop just a minute. Why we have revivals? Why do we assemble ourselves together? Why am I always rebuking the people? Why am I calling to you Pentecostal women: “Quit wearing paints, make-up, and bobbing your hair, and stuff like that”? Why am I saying that? Because, the old-fashion way of pentecost used to not do that. The real Bible way is not to do that. You wearing these shorts and clothes that pertains to men, do you know the Bible says that that’s an abomination to God? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] But we permit it. Why does the Holy Spirit keep crying out? It knows there’s something lacking there. We must be in the full stature of Jesus Christ. We must be sons and daughters of God. We must act like God’s children. Long ago, a little story was told. I noticed one colored brother setting in the back. In the South, they used to sell slaves. And this, when they had slaves down there, when slavery was, before the emancipation, of the proclamation. And they would go by and buy them, them people, just like they would a used car, dealer. They had a bill of sales, and sold them human beings just like they were used cars. You got a bill of sales with them. One time a buyer come by, a broker. And he was going to … He’d go around these big plantations and buy slaves. And he come to a certain big plantation where they had many slaves, and he wanted to see how many they had. And there was all of them out there, working. And they were sad. They were away from home. They was from Africa. They had brought them over here. The Boers had brought them over and sold them for slaves, and so they were sad. They know they’d never go back home again. They’d live and die in the land. And they had, many times, they’d carry whips and whip them. They were property of the owner, and he did with them what he wanted to. And they just … If he killed it, he killed it. And if he, whatever it was, he just did it. That’s slavery, like Israel was, and many of the nations had been brought into slavery. And they’d have to take them poor slaves. They just served. They were crying, you know, all time, and sad. But they noticed one of them slaves, young fellow, he had his chest stuck out, his head up like that. Never had to whip him. Never had to tell him what to do. So that broker said, “I want to buy that slave.” He said, “He’s not for sale.” He said, “I would like to buy him.” He said, “No. He’s not for sale.” Said, “Is he the boss of the rest of them?” Said, “No.” Said, “He’s not the boss. He is slave.” He said, “Well, maybe you feed him different than you feed the rest of them.” Said, “No. They all eat out there in the galley, together.” He said, “What makes that boy so much different than the rest of them?” He said, “Here is one thing. I wondered for a while, too. But that boy, an alien from Africa, but in Africa his father is the king of the tribe. And, yet, he’s an alien away from home. He conducts himself as a king’s son. He knows that, across the land, that his father is the king of the tribe. And now he conducts himself, because he knows he’s a son of a king.” Oh, brother, sister, you and I, in this world that we live, let’s conduct ourselves as sons and daughters of God. We’re aliens here, but our behavior ought to be according to the commandments of God, that we are sons and daughters of God. Our behavior, we should act and do, and everything, according to what the laws that God laid down. “And it’s an abomination for a woman to wear a garment that pertains to a man.” It’s wrong and sinful, “For her to cut her hair,” the Bible said so, “uncommon thing for her to even pray.” You say, “What about this?” Someone got after me; a great, noted minister, not long ago. Said, “Brother Branham, come. I want to lay hands on you.” Said, “You’re going to ruin your ministry.” I said, “What?” Said, “Bawling them people out like that.” I said, “I’m telling the … ” Said, “I believe that.” Said, “I’m a Pentecostal, too. I believe that women shouldn’t wear short hair, shouldn’t wear paints, and these things like that the way they do, paint their faces up.” Said, “They shouldn’t do that. But,” said, “God called you to pray for the sick.” I said, “He called me to preach the Gospel.” And he said, “I believe in that. But,” said, “you think that?” I said, “Yeah. Look what you got, all these big programs, televisions, and everything else. I ain’t got nothing but God to answer to.” That’s right. I said, “I don’t have nothing but God to answer to.” He said, “I … You’re going to ruin your ministry.” I said, “Any ministry that the Word of God will ruin, ought to be ruined.” That’s right. Certainly. That’s exactly. He said, “Well, you’re going to ruin it.” I said, “Who is going to tell It then? See? Somebody has got to say It. Somebody has got to stand for that what’s Truth, no matter what It hurts.” And friends, as Christian, as people that believe we’re going to Heaven, the Holy Spirit Itself will type us in the Word of God. He said, “You know what you ought to do?” Said, “People believe you to be a prophet.” Said, “You ought to be teaching these women how to get gifts of prophecy and things like that, and great, higher things instead of little thing.” I said, “How am I going to teach them algebra when they won’t even learn their ABC’s? When they won’t even do the common thing, see, the natural thing, how you going to tell them high things?” When you won’t even start from the … You want to get on top the ladder before you hit the first. That’s the reason you fall. See? Begin at the bottom, and climb right on up as God leads you up. See? Cope your life and ever follow every bit of the Word that God has ordained for you to do. Now think how that God … We should behave ourselves and act like Christians. Our conduct should be like Christians. Because, we are aliens here. This is not our Home. No. We were just put here, temporarily. We’ve got to go, every one of us, tonight. Now think. If God, in His mercy, has the mother, before the little baby is born, it’s craving for some vitamin, and the mother’s words speaks forth, “Dad, I want cantaloupe, or watermelon. I want something, another.” It’s out of … Why, he’ll do everything he can, to get that, because he knows that he wants his child born as perfect as it can be. See? And he’ll do everything that he’s able to do, to get it. How much more able-er is He, to get it! He’s a Creator. Now think how able He is, to prepare us a body, to live like His Own glorious body, if we want to live. There is something in us, calls, to live. And there is something in us that calls to do right. Then God will call somebody on the platform, or the pulpit, that will preach the absolute Truth. Why? See? It shows you. Then, if you’re a real child of God, you begin to cry out, “God, take it away from me. Circumcise me from this. Take these things away from me.” Why? It’s needed for your heavenly Home that you’re going to, where He’s gone on to prepare. You got to be a real Word Bride of Christ. I was preaching a few nights ago on the sacrifice, in the days of the atonement. I was preaching on the only place that God, the only Church that God will meet a man in, and that’s in, He said, the place that He put His Name. He said, “I won’t meet them in any other place but the place, the gate that I put My Name in.” Now, He don’t meet you in the Methodist gate, Baptist gate, or Pentecostal gate, or any of them. But He put His Name in His Son. He said, “I came in My Father’s Name.” Any man comes, and any child, comes in his father’s name. He … I come in the name of a Branham, because my father was a Branham. And you come in your name because that was your father’s name. And Jesus, the Son, came in the Father’s Name. And He said He put His Name, “In this gate that I put My Name in, that was the sacrifice.” And in Jesus Christ is the only place that you’ll ever find fellowship and worship to God. You say, “Well, I belong to the church.” That don’t make one thing different. You’ve got to be in Christ. A certain denominational minister, the other night, said to me, said, “Mr. Branham, look here. Jesus said, ‘Whosoever believeth.’ The Bible said, ‘Whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, is born of the Spirit of God.’” I said, “Don’t the Bible also say, that, ‘No man can call Jesus the Christ, only by the Holy Ghost’?” See? You can’t make the Bible lie. It’s got to hook right in. So you have to become absolutely born again, of the Holy Spirit in you, that witness out, yourself, you know that He is the Son of God. And then if you are, and a part; if you are a child of God, in the Word of God; how can you deny the Word? How can the Holy Spirit make you believe a creed, that you have to do something like this, when the Bible said something else? “We have to join a church, and do this, or do that,” when the Bible plainly tells you what to do? See? And then when you see That, and you jump right into It, you’re right with It then. Just keep moving right on up, and just grows. Like a germ coming into the womb of a woman with the egg. And then when that little egg begins to develop, and begins to bring forth germs, it don’t put one human germ, and a dog germ, and a cow germ. It puts all human germ. And when a child of God, when that predestinated … That’s a bad word to use, but it’s God. Here is God’s Bible. The foreknowledge of God can predestinate, make everything work to His honor. When that predestinated seed, that you was to be, and God called you, and that little eagle of a seed in there heard the Word of God, it will build on top, one Word on top the other one, on top the other one, on top the other one. It’ll not mix with any creed. Notice. “In these gates, every day, they should eat new kosher. And there would be no leaven found among them, through the seven days.” Is that right? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] The seven church ages, then, no unleaven, no creed, no nothing added. It has to be absolutely unleaven bread. “No leaven shall be found among you, at all.” Just a leaven, the Word Itself, that’s the only. And that Word is God. And God was made flesh, in the Person of Jesus Christ, which, that is the Gate. “There is the Gate I meet you in, to worship, when you follow the commandments of God.” Therefore, if you’ve, tonight, just come, say, “I offer Jesus Christ my life,” and you’ve never received the Holy Ghost; come into It. You must do it. You must grow into It. Ask God to pile Word on top of Word, like that, until you become the full stature of a son of God, or a daughter of God. Taking the things of the world? First John says, “If you love the world, or the things of the world, it’s because the love of God is not even in you.” You’ve been deceived. You got the love of the world there, and it’s deceived you, the devil has, by piling things on to there, and showing. See? You can’t … Well, then, you cannot take one Word of God out of the Bible. What caused the first sin? Not by just a big point blank lie, but because Eve misconstrued, the devil did to her, one Word. One Word, broke the chain, and refused to take one Word. That was the beginning of the Bible. Jesus came in the center of the Bible. He said, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” That’s the entire Word of God. You believe That’s the revelation of Him? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] The entire Word of God. Then, in Revelation 22, Jesus came to John, on the isle of Patmos. And Jesus, “I Jesus have sent My angel to testify of these things.” See? “Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, I’ll take his part from the Book of Life.” Not just say, “Well, I believe Jesus Christ, Son of God.” That’s all right. Then add the rest of It to it. You say, “I been justified. I give my hand to the minister. I believe in Jesus Christ.” Then you’ve got to be born-again. You must be filled with the Holy Ghost. See? Just keep adding on, as you keep on going. You’re growing into the stature of a son and daughter of God. My! God, able to prepare us, and to give to us that crave in our life, that we want to see something. How many in here wants more of God? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Why, it goes to show there is more for you. See? You’re craving it. Your little birth pains are coming on. See? You need more, so that we can be happy, and free, and perfect. We got to be. Like the little germ of life being the … in the bosom of God, just like, and the germ of life is in the bo- … in the bosom of the mother. God is growing; and going, gone, to prepare the place for us, the Eternal place with Himself; not a place where there’s a pesthouse, a dying, sin, adultery, and filth of the world here. If your mind is on that, it shows it never has come in contact with God. See? You’re worked up. You got a mental illusion. You just join church and say, “Well, I belong to this. My mother belonged to that.” That might have been all right in your mother’s day, but we’re living in another day. Wesley’s message would have never … He just couldn’t take Luther. Luther believed in justification, but Wesley had sanctification. The Pentecostals come along, they couldn’t take just justification, sanctification. They, it was time for the restoration of the gifts. Now we’re going from that. See? The three stages of the Vine coming up. The first, it’s a little blade, Luther come up, from the reformation. All right. That was the stalk. Watch nature. God and nature works in continuity, because God is in nature. See? The next come, the tassel, the pollen, the Methodist age. Then come the Pentecostal, oh, my, just so perfect, see, just like the grain of wheat looks like it’s perfect wheat, grain of wheat. Open it up, there’s no wheat there, at all. It’s a shuck, a carrier of It, but that Life is working on through. See? Them back there in the Luther age accept Luther. That Life come through, but it went and denominated out. The first thing you know, just become a denominational whose end is to be burned. See? The stalk dries up; is just a carrier. Some of them still try to stay in that old carrier stalk, know nothing about God, dead. They say, “Well, look, we’re a leaf. We was a Luther.” That’s right. But look where it’s at now. See? “We were a Methodist.” And even, “We were a Pentecostal.” But look at Pentecost, how cold and formal it’s getting, how everybody walking away. See? What is it? It was a carrier of the real Seed. See? All these others was carrier, but went denomination. If you say, “I’m Pentecost,” that’s don’t mean no more to God than if you said you was a Roman Catholic or a Jew, or whatever you might be. You’ve got to be born, that Life that come through that carrier there. Don’t stay in the stalk. Don’t stay in the seed. Go right on out to the perfect part. Now, remember, and every reformation we’ve had, on all those Lutherans and so forth, in three years they organize. That’s right. Every revival brought a organization in three years. Think how long this been going on, twenty-something years, and no organization. Why? It’s the Seed, coming, forming under the husk, like this. Laying out, now it’s got to lay in the Presence of the Son, to ripen into the glorious grain like the One that went into the first. The real Church that went down, first, is coming right back up through the stalk, to come out, another Church, when the combine comes to pick It up. The Life that went down in Luther, the Life that went down in the Methodist, the Life that went down in the Pentecostal, will come into the grain. It’ll all go right into the grain, and go out, forming the perfect Body of Jesus Christ. Just like the sun comes up, of morn. You can’t look at no nature ’less it testifies of God. You don’t need even the Bible, to know there’s a God. The little sun born, a little weak baby. About seven o’clock, goes, starts off to school. Ten or eleven o’clock, it’s out. Twelve o’clock, it’s in its strength. Three o’clock in the afternoon, it’s getting old. Seven or eight, six … Five or six o’clock in the afternoon, she’s getting stooped-shouldered. It dies. Is that the end of it? No. It resurrects again the next morning. The life, death, burial, resurrection! Look at the leaves come on the trees. It comes up, a good, fine leaf; brings out shade; puts out its fruit. Next, first thing you know, autumn comes, strikes it, death; runs right down into the root, into the ground again. Is that the end of it? Next spring she comes right back again to testify. Oh! That’s perpetual life. But, brother, sister, we got Eternal Life. We’ve got Eternal Life through this great One Who came, has gone, is able to prepare us a body. And these growing pains we feel, like you women feel condemned of what you do, you men that hangs on to seminary doctrines, and so forth, you all want to say, “I recite this creed. I do this.” But there’s something right down in you, when you see the eyes of the blind opened; the deaf unders- … blind. All these things that’s promised. See the Word preached in Its power. See a prostitute, off the street, made a lady. See a drunkard come out of there, and be a real saint of God. My! See? There’s something, Life in there. And you begin to feel, “Well, maybe I oughtn’t to do that.” But, see, what it is, it’s something your Body yonder is needing. “Come on.” But God’s got the vitamins right in Here for every bit of that Body. Jesus has gone to prepare the place in the bosom of God; yes, sir, a little germ, son of God, little son or daughter of God. Jesus only asked for one thing, in His prayer to the Father. You know what that was? One thing, after all of His sacrifice that He did here on earth, the life that He lived, the path that He walked. He asked for one thing, “That where I am, they may be also.” He asked for our fellowship. That’s the only thing He asked the Father in the prayer, your companionship forever. If you want to read this in Saint John 17, the 24th verse. Then how much should we desire Him? If He desire … Now listen. If you really are born of the Spirit of God, that means everything to you. See? It ain’t some book of rules. You don’t live any laws and so forth. You live by the grace of God, the Spirit of God. I’ve often said this. As a missionary, I’d be going overseas. What if I brought my wife in, my children, “Now looky here, children! Listen here, Mrs. Branham! I am your husband. Thou shall not have any other husbands while I’m gone. If you do, I’ll skin you when I get back home”? Uh-huh. See? Stomp my foot, “Children, hear what I say?” “Yeah. Yes, papa. Yes, papa.” “You let me hear of one transgression? See?” See? Now, wouldn’t that be a home? Now what if she say, “Now, you through, sir? Now I want to tell you something. Mr. Branham, I am your lawful wedded wife! Thou shall not have any other girl friends while you’re gone, either”? Now, wouldn’t that be a home? Now, that would be something. We don’t do that. I love her, and she loves me. When she knows I’m going, she knows I don’t go ’less the Lord calls me to go. We get down on the floor, and get the children around. We pray. I said, “Dear God, take care of my little companion, my children.” They say, “God, take care of daddy while we’re gone, while he’s gone.” And then when we go over … Now, what if I did do something wrong over there? What if I did transgress, do something wrong? And I come back and went to that poor little wife of mine, stood there and look at her face wrinkling, and her hair turning gray, I walked up and said, “Honey, I want to tell you something. You know I love you.” “Sure, Bill, I know you love me.” “I tell you what I done. I took some girl home.” I say, “Will you forgive me for it?” I believe she would. I really do. But would I do that? When I look, standing there, see them hairs turning gray, and know she has stood between me and the public, and I know what a real wife she has been, could I do that? I’d rather die than hurt her. I would. And if that, in phileo love to my wife, how much greater is my agapao love to God! Oh, I wouldn’t do nothing to hurt Him. Certainly not. I love Him. I want to do everything that He wants me to do. I want to cope with every Word that He said, no matter what the world says. They, they ain’t going to believe It, anyhow. I want to know what He said for me to do. And if I lack something, I want Him to give it to me. And live for Him, keeping ourselves from the world. This old earthly body here has got to its … Let me tell you. This earthly body that you think so much of, that you pattern after Hollywood. You’re so close to it. It won’t be there much longer. You remember. You’ve heard the prophecy, see, that the Lord give me, “It’s going under.” Yes, sir. Notice. It will. You just watch. Now, It never told me nothing wrong, yet. I’ll take that to anybody that wants to say. I don’t know when or where, but she’s done. Judgment hangs over it. There’s no redemption for it; it’s passed. See? Now notice this. Live for Him, keeping ourselves from the world. Now look. You look on television, some of you sisters, and you go down here and you want, you young women. You’re young. I know that. But you’re Christians. See? You’re different. You don’t want to be like the world. You love the world. It’s not only you young ones; some of you older ones. See? Well, what does that? See? You watch television, you go down to the store, you see these little old clothes that women wear, that’s ungodly. Do you know what’s going to happen at the Day of Judgment? You might be just as virtuous to your husband as you can be, but in the Day of Judgment you’re going to have to answer for committing adultery. Jesus said, “Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.” Who is to blame? You. See? You presented yourself, them shorts and slacks. Some woman said to me, not long ago, said, “I don’t wear shorts, Brother Branham. I thank the Lord for that. I wear slacks.” I said, “That’s worse.” That’s worse. That’s right. You can’t even buy a dress, hardly, for a woman. She said, one woman said, “Well, you said the truth. ‘You can’t. You can’t buy it.’” But they still sell goods and have sewing machines. See? So there’s no excuse, at all. See? See? It goes to show, sister. I’m your brother. And I’m a servant to Christ, that’s got to answer at the Judgment Bar for what I say here tonight. See? You’re going to stand, guilty of adultery, because that the love of God has leaked out of your heart. You still go to church. You might still dance in the Spirit. You might still speak with tongues. And them things are fine, but that’s not It yet. No, sir. Remember, the Bible said, “In the last days there shall come false Christs,” not false Jesuses. They wouldn’t stand still for that. But, “false Christs,” false anointed-ones. They’re absolutely anointed with the Spirit, with the Holy Spirit, and still false. See? There’s two … There’s three people of you. The outside is the body. You got five senses, that you contact your earthly home with that. The inside is a spirit. There’s five senses there, love and conscience, and so forth, you contact. But the inside of that is the soul. Remember, “The rain falls on the just and the unjust.” The same rain that’ll make a grain of wheat grow makes a cocklebur grow too. See? What is it? At the inside of that seed is a nature, and that nature display, displays itself. It can stand in the same field, right there with the weed. The weed and the wheat stand together, rejoice just as much. Its head is down. It’s starving for a drink. When a rain comes, the cocklebur can shout just as loud as the wheat can. “But by their fruits you shall know them.” See? Christians, I may never see you again. See, it’s been years since I been here. May never see you again. Line up with God’s Word. Look in the mirror. Like a little boy one time, had been out in the country, never seen a mirror. He come to his auntie’s house. He started walking up the steps. He seen a mirror, and he seen a little boy in the mirror. He kept walking up, looking. And he would wave, and the little boy would wave. And he kept looking. He never seen himself in a mirror. So when he got close enough to it, he turn around, said, “Why, Mama, that’s me!” How do you look, in God’s mirror? Does it reflect a daughter or a son of God? Is there something, which, you hear That, does it make you hate the man that’s saying It? Or, is there something pull, say, “I know that man is right because that’s in the Scripture”? Then, that’s the vitamins needed for this body that’s ordained to be there, a house that that other one is going to need when you get there. See? “This house; if we have borne an earthy.” Now remember, we think so much of this body. We put so many clothes on it. We do so many things, that, unnecessary, change after change after change, and all these things. And, oh, it’s just everybody. Just let somebody start something. You paint your steps red and watch the Joneses paint theirs red. You change from a Chevrolet to a Ford, and they just can’t stand it. It’s matching time. You let the … You let a woman come to church, certain kind of a hat on, watch all the women get that; especially the pastor’s wife, see, just watch what happens. Now, that is true. That is the absolutely truth. It’s matching time. Brother, it ought to be matching time. And all them things is for a purpose. I don’t care whether my coat matches my trousers. And I have a hard time. My wife or my daughter-in-law, someone, have to tell me what kind of tie to wear with it. I don’t care whether they match, though. I want my experience to match God’s Word. That’s the thing, ’cause that’s where I aim to live; not down on the corner yonder with the Joneses, but yonder in Glory where Jesus is, gone to prepare us a place. Yes, we want that. Yes, sir. Keep from all this. This old earthly tabernacle here, you know what it is? This body is like an old coat that you wear, a coat that you once wear. But now you have one so much better, you don’t use it any more. What do you do? You hang it in the closet, for you’ve got one better. You’ve got a better coat. It’s more up to date than the one you used to wear, that’s worn out. What? It is that garment. You are the inside of that there. That garment only done what? It bore your image. See? But you don’t need it any more now. You’ve hung it up. It’s a rag. And that’s the way this old body is, you, it’s bore the image of the heavenly. Yet, it is not you. You are on the inside of that body. You, the Spirit of God, is on the inside of that body. That’s what makes the outside come into subjections, because the inside is pulling it, see, bringing it in line with the Word of God; your inside, you yourself, your being. This body is just an old coat. And someday, what will you do with it, for you was only in the garment for a while? That is like the earthly garment; this body. Your real body, your real self, is on the inside of this old coat that you call William Branham, or Susie Jones, or whoever it is. See? Someday it will hang in the earth’s hall of memory of you. You’ll put it out yonder in the grave, and somebody will put a tombstone up, “Here lies Rev. So-and-so, or John So-and-so, or So-and-so.” It’ll lie there as a memorial of you. The people just seen you in this. And what you was, your real you, was on the inside of that. But the old coat, itself, just “borne the image of the Heavenly.” Oh, people, have you made reservations to change coats? Have you made reservations for Heaven? Remember, you must have reservations. You can’t get in without them. I’m talking to you in modern language now, that you know. If you go to the hotel, say, “Well, I had the … ” “Did you have reservations? Well, I’m sorry. Everything is filled up.” You’re out in the cold, because you failed to make reservations. And if you come to the end of your life’s journey, without reservations, there will be no One there to meet you. You’ll have to step off into a dark Eternity where there will be screaming, and weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. You must. You can’t get into the City, you, because you haven’t got reservation. You must have them, to enter the City, where Jesus has gone to prepare a place for you. Remember, you must have the reservations, and the garment of salvation, on. You cannot. In Matthew, I got a Scripture here. I’m watching Scripture, Matthew, twenty- … 22:1 to 14. I haven’t time to read it, because it’s getting too late. I’ve spoke too long, to you. But remember, the king sent forth and made a supper. He killed all of his oxes, and fixed the fatlings and everything, had a great supper prepared. And he sent out, and he bid many to come. One said, “Well, you know, after all, I belong to this.” “And I got this.” “I got to go with my farm.” And one did many things. And he sent again, and they evilly mistreated them. And finally … That was the Jewish generation, Jesus was talking to. They had something else to do. Then, finally, he sent in, “And say … Go. Just don’t … Just compel them. Go into the streets and highways, and everywhere, and compel them to come in.” And after that, determined that his house was … His wedding supper was going to be set. There’s going to be guests there. And then he found a man in there without the wedding garment on. He wanted to hold to the old coat. And look what he said. “Friend, after I have invited you to my wedding supper, and I invited you and give you an invitation to come!” And if you ever was in the Orients, which I preached in there many time, that wedding supper is still carried on just the way it was. The bridegroom, that, all, he has so many guests that he’s going to have. Probably, Brother Kopp, probably you’ve watched it there in India. See? They have so many guests that he’s going to ask; say he’s going to ask thirty guests. Now, the bridegroom has to furnish the robes. He has to furnish them, therefore there’s a man stands at the door. And you come up with your invitation. He examines your invitation and puts you on a garment, a robe. That, some of them are rich, and some of them are poor, and some of them are different, but they all look alike when they get these robes on. They all look alike. And you have to all be alike. You ain’t going to be, say, “I’m the Methodist over here. I’m the Presbyterian over here.” Oh, no. You ain’t going in, the first place. See? You’ve got to come by the Door. Jesus said, “I am the Door to the sheepfold.” “I’m Pentecostal. I’m this. I’m that.” That don’t mean one thing. You come by that Door. And if you come by that Door, you get the robe. And this man, when he said, “How did you get in here, friend?” See? It showed he come up some other way, and come in a window, come in the back way, but not through the door; not through the Door, the way that Jesus came, through self-sacrifice; giving your all to God, and walking to Calvary and be crucified with Him. And rise again, to wear His garment of sacrifice and death to the things of the world. “If you love the world, or the things of the world, the love of God is not even in you.” See? If you still have the love of the world, want to act like the world, and do like the world; you’re try … you’re … Yet, you’re in the church, but a cocklebur in the patch with the wheat; shout with the rest of them, rejoice with the rest of them. All the spiritual blessings is right upon you. You say, “Well, I prophesy.” So did Caiaphas. So did Balaam. That has nothing … “I got the baptism, the Holy Spirit.” That still has nothing to do with it. That’s just only a temporal gift for you. The real gift is your soul down in there, see, that was born of God, and that controls the whole thing to the Word of God and the will of God. And there you grow up, see, then you’re a son and daughter of God. You’re a child of God. And these things, as you come up … Like the mother, now you’re in the bowels of the earth, trying to come forth. You’re a son of God, coming forth, and you see the Word says, “I should do this. I should be born-again.” “Well, I belong to church.” That don’t mean one thing. See? “I’m Methodist; my mother.” That’s good for your mother. “Well, my, I’m Pentecostal. I belong.” That, if you don’t line with that Word, there is something wrong. See? Then, you see, your real father ain’t God. See? Because, that real start in your soul, before there even was a spirit, it was your soul. That soul didn’t come from God, then it wasn’t a germ of God, to begin. You’re deceived. You’re in a patch of weeds and bearing the world’s record of the weeds coming forth. Acting like the world, loving the world, is because the love of God is not in you. And now there’ll be false anointed-ones in the last days, not false Jesus. They wouldn’t stand for that. But, “false,” anointed. They are anointed, yes, sir, but they’re anti-Christ. They’re anointed with the Spirit, to do the signs and wonders that Christ did, but won’t line up with His Word. See? “Many will come to Me, that Day, and say, ‘Lord, have not I prophesied, and cast out devils, in Your Name?’” He say, “Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I never even knew you.” “I was Pentecostal, Lord. Glory to God! I shouted. I spoke with tongues. And I laid hands on the sick, and healed them, cast out devils.” “Depart from Me, you that work iniquity. I never knew you.” See what I mean? Oh, little children, do you feel the need of that vitamin tonight, that something? There’s a body waiting yonder. There’s a body waiting to be received. People, don’t be deceived. Don’t be deceived. The devil is a deceiver. Even the wedding garment, you must wear It. It must be. Now we’re at the evening time. The earthly body is now ready to be dissolved, and we’re preparing to enter into the Heavenly. And we now feel the strange call, of God, to go to this great Eden. And before we can be born here, our little bodies cried for something that had to be provided, or we’d be an afflicted child here if we wasn’t. God has no afflictions up there. They’re, every one, perfectly lined up, the Bride just exactly like the Groom was, the Word manifested in Its season. God grant, tonight, children, each and every one of you! There is a Heaven to go to. There’s a hell to stay away from. Now, many of you know that the Lord has given me visions, thousands of those. The greatest thing … I used to fear death. About three years ago, you seen the Christian Business Men, Past The Curtain Of Time. I realize I might not live through this night. I may never see you again in my life here, but this is true. I don’t know whether I’d call this a vision, or what it was. One morning, recently, I was … I had just woke up. I come in from meetings. And my wife was laying there, asleep. I said, “Honey, are you awake?” She was still sleeping. I know we had to get up, to get the children off to school. And I put my hands back up, like this, and I said, “Well, say, Bill Branham, do you know you’re past fifty? You, if you’re going to do something for the Lord, you better hurry up, ’cause you ain’t got too much more time.” I thought, “My, I hope that I can live to see the Coming of the Lord Jesus.” I always had it in my mind, that when we died, I’d see, like, brother here. I’d say … “Yeah, you preached in my church, one night down on earth, Brother Branham.” But, he’s a spirit, I couldn’t shake his hand, because his hand is out there in the grave, rotted away, see; mine, too. I used to kind of think that. But that morning, when, I felt Something come over me. And I thought … Usually, like a vision comes. And I looked, and I looked. I thought, “My! What is this?” And I looked, a great, green hills. And young women was coming from everywhere, by the tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. And they were all coming, long hair hanging down their back, white robes on, barefooted, screaming, hollering, “Our brother!” I thought, “Now, this is strange.” I turned back around and looked. And there I laid right there, and there was my wife, laying there on the bed. And I said, “Now, you know what? I died.” I said, “That, that’s what’s happened. I’ve died.” And I said, “I might have had a heart attack, or something. I’ve died. There lays my body.” I was just laying there with my hands back, like that, just as stiff. I thought, “That’s not twenty feet from me.” And there I was, looking. I thought, “That’s … There is my wife there. There, there is everything. There is my shirt hanging there on that bedpost there.” And I thought, “Here I am.” I looked around again, and these women were all coming. And they were … I looked, coming this way, and there come my brothers. Oh! They’re genuine. All of them looked to be young men. They were screaming, “Our precious brother!” Oh, I didn’t know what to think. I thought, “This is strange.” I looked back, and I wasn’t an old man. I was young. I thought, “This is a strange thing.” I thought, “Is this a vision?” I’d bite my finger. And I thought, “No. It ain’t the kind of vision I’ve had.” Then, there, Something begin to talk to me up here, and said, “You’ve entered in with your people.” I thought, “With my people? Are all these Branhams?” He said, “They’re your converts to Christ.” And these women … You know I’ve always been considered, on account of they’d call me “woman-hater,” but I’m not. See? Cause, I believe … I don’t like immoral, indecent. I like real, genuine sisters of Christ. If that way, all right. I had some scars when I was a kid. I know things that happened that’s kind of turned me that way. But it was all God, making, molding me for this hour. See? I think a real, genuine sister, there’s nothing any nicer. If God could give a man anything better than salvation, He’d give him a wife. See? And so, then, if He could give anything better, He would have done it. And then to see some of them turn and don’t even act like a wife, unloyal to their marriage vows, and their husbands the same. You remember, you’re bound as long as you live, to one another. “What God joins on earth, joined in Heaven also.” See? And so then I seen that. And these women run up and was throwing their arms around me, and hugging me, and call me, “Brother!” Now, they were women, but there can never be sin in that place. See? They were women. But, see, what made us now, a woman with a gland, a female gland, and a man with a male gland, it’s for raising children. There it won’t be. They’ll all be one gland, but they’ll still be in the form. The earthly image that they bore here will be there, but there’ll never can be sin. You’re all the same. There’ll be no more children raised there. See? That’s right. It’ll all be that way. And so I looked, and these women. And they picked me up. These brothers set me up on a place. I said, “Why’d you do this?” He said, “In earth you was a leader.” And said, “You … These are the people.” And there was some woman come up. She said, “Our precious brother.” Most beautiful woman! When she passed by, this Voice stopped, said, “Don’t you remember her?” I said, “No.” Said, “You led her to Christ when she was past ninety. See? Can’t you see why she says ‘precious brother’?” I said, “Well, do you go … ” Said, “No. We’re waiting here.” I said, “Well, if I’ve passed over, I want to see Jesus.” Said, “You can’t see Him now. This is the Scripture, said, ‘Souls under the altar.’ He’s just a little higher. Someday He will return. We’re go back to earth. We don’t eat or drink here.” I said, “You mean I was afraid of this? Why, this … ” There’s no word to speak it, friends. “It’s perfect,” wouldn’t touch it, “sublime.” There’s no English vocabulary that I know, no word at all, that could ever express what it is. It’s beyond anything that I know. There he was. There was no sickness, no sorrow. You couldn’t die. You couldn’t sin. It was just perfect, just perfect. Friends, you mustn’t, you mustn’t miss it. Remember. And when I was a little boy, I saw a vision of hell, as a little boy. And you know how the ladies, today, or the women (lady wouldn’t do a thing like that), paint their eyes like a wolf, or something like that, that blue stuff under their eye. I seen that. I was sinking. As a little boy, I had been shot, and I was laying, dying in a hospital. And I had always knowed there was God. I remember the first prayer I ever tried to pray. The only thing I could say … I’ve never told this before. I just feel I’ll tell it right now. I was shot, laying there, dying in a field. And the only plea that I could have to God, I said, “You know, Lord, I never did commit adultery.” See? As a little, young boy about fifteen years old, I tried to live right. And I said, “I’ve lived clean.” And that’s all I could say. That’s all the merit that I could offer Him. And then laying there, then, when the doctor done walked away from me, and I felt myself sinking into a dark Eternity, and looked like. I holler for papa, “Oh, papa, help me.” There was no papa there. “Mama, help me.” There was no mama there. “God, help me.” There was no God there. It was just the endless, horrible, oh, nightmare. Burning, blazing hell would be a pleasure, being up aside of that. And falling through there, I thought, “Oh, my!” Over and over, like this. I got into a place, smoke, and dark, and sick. And, oh, such a feeling! It was death on me. And I could see those women coming up to me, with them kind of painted eyes like that. Now remember, that’s been forty-five years ago, about forty years ago, anyhow. Going, they was going, “Oooh! Oooh! Oooh!” I said, “Am I to be there forever?” “Forever.” I said, “O God, if You’ll let me out of here, I’ll never be ashamed of You again. I’ll never be ashamed. God, please give me a chance.” The first thing you know, I felt myself coming back up. And the doctor was alarmed, ’cause my heart was only beating seventeen times to the minute. I done bled all my blood out and everything, was laying in my own blood. And I’ve wondered, someday that would happen? About two years ago, when I moved to Tucson, I was with my wife down at J. C. Penney’s. I was setting there like that, and with my head down, waiting. Cause, you know how, ladies, they shop a long time. And I was setting there, my head down like this. And an escalator was coming up. And here come some of them women up, with them waterhead haircuts, you know, like they do, like that. Coming up with them painted-looking eyes like that. And they were speaking Spanish. And that’s that. It all (the vision) reoccurred again. There it was, “Oooh! Oooh!” Brother, sister, let me tell you something. It may seem funny now, but you once get there. It’s a serious thing. Don’t you never go that way. Me, as an old man, a minister, I preached around the world, got millions of friends, but I know I’ve got to stand with you yonder. Get away from the things of the world. And if there is something in you, that you still want to act the way you act, if you do have the things of the world in you, remember, you’re none of God’s. You’re just a church member, until that call; that deep, calling to the Deep. See? Like, before there was a fin on a fish’s back, there had to be a water for him to swim in, first, or he’d never had a fin. Before there was a tree to grow in the earth, there had to be an earth, or there would have been no tree to grow in it. There’d be no reason for the tree, and to make it coexist. Before there is a creation, there has to be a Creator. “Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness.” See? There is something in us. You raised your hand a while ago, “I want more of God.” See? There is something needy. And if you love the world, going that way, the things of the world, the world’s travel you’ll go, and in the fall you’ll be. See? Come out. You’re sons and daughters of a King, the King. Be lady and gentleman. Walk like Christians. Live like Christians. Act like Christians. Remember, I’ll meet you at the Judgment Bar with these remarks. See? Look in your looking glass, tonight, and see. “Which way am I headed? Is Jesus preparing a place for me, a body? That body is perfect. That body walks orderly. It’s a son or a daughter before God. And I’m birth pains in here, to be born into that body there. If I still love the world, it shows me that (I’m not) I have no body there. I’m just a church member. I wasn’t the germ of God. I am not. He is not my Father.” He said, “If you cannot stand chastisement,” that’s what you’re getting now, “then you’re bastard children, and not the children of God.” Isn’t that right? [Congregation says, “Right.”] Does the Bible say that? [“Amen.”] If you cannot stand the chastisement of God, when you see the Scripture lining you up, and you say, “Oh, I don’t want to hear that Stuff. I’m a Christian. I do a … ” All right. Go ahead. See? It’s one sure evidence that you’re not a child of God. But a real child of God is hungering and thirsting. Why? If there’s something in your heart, telling you you want it, and it needs there, it shows there’s something pulsating, trying to pull you there. There’s a body there, that this one is a type of here. What are you using this one for, to glorify the devil and the world, and fashions and things? Are you looking towards Heaven, there’s something up there, you’re glorifying God with your life? In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it wasn’t so, I would have told you. And I’ll go and prepare a place for you.  … and come again, to receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. Things That Are To Be. These things that are now, are only potential, calling for the things that is to be. Let us pray. Think seriously. Will you, dear Christian friends? Think real seriously, just a moment. Let’s just be real quiet just for a moment. Let the Holy Spirit speak. Now, the Lord Jesus sent me to you Pentecostal people, long ago. Here is one of your boys that’s come up to be your pastor, said, “Resulted from the ministry.” He seen the Lord Jesus open the blinded eyes; “make,” he said, “the waterheads shrink right up.” I still have healing services. But I realize that I have prayed for many people that were very sick. They were healed. The Lord answered prayer, and healed the sick. But, you know, some of those people, were healed, has already died. And no matter how sick you are, if you’re healed, you’re going to die, anyhow. But that soul, my precious brother, that soul, my precious sister, won’t you think about it now? That’s Eternal. If that love of God is not in there, there is nothing pulling, won’t you ask God, “O God, start me over, new, tonight. I love You, Lord. I want to love You. And something in my heart tells me that I must live closer to You. I want to come, right now, Lord, and do that”? If that person or persons are in this building or out of this building, I ask you, as a servant of Christ, in the Name of Jesus Christ, will you just, with your head bowed, raise up your hand to God and say this much, “God, draw me nearer, nearer, dear God. I want to line with everything that You have in Your Word”? Raise your hands. Now just be real honest. Just think. Now, they say, “Oh, I’ve done this. I, I’ve shouted, the Spirit. I’ve spoke in tongues. But, look, there is something lacking in my life. I look in the mirror of God’s Word, I know there’s something. I go to church, but I’m not what I should be.” See? That shows that, something. Now, if you can look at yourself and see that you’re not lined up with God’s Word, and there’s nothing in there that’ll cause you to raise your hand, then you know there’s something wrong. You have. There’s … Mother used to say, “You can’t get blood from a turnip, because there’s no blood in it.” See? Think of it, real seriously. This might be your last opportunity. Thirty, forty hands has been up, this little group here, even to clergymen. Just be real reverent just a moment. Now think real straight. “Dear God, I may be killed, tonight, in an accident. I may die in a heart attack. One of these mornings, I may call the doctor, and he come, and my pulse is beating up my sleeve; I’m gone. I’m pressing my cheek against the pillows, call, ‘O God! O God! O God!’” See? That heart is making its last beat. You’re coming to that great Door. You’ll never come out unless you’re born again of the Spirit of God. You’ll never come out unless there’s something in you, after you’re born of the Spirit of God, hungering and thirsting to go on with God. It must be. See? You’re a child in the earth, in the bowels of the earth, still waiting to be born into the Kingdom of God, where He’s gone to prepare another body for you, that’s a perfect body. Now think real deep, and let’s pray together. Dear God, as I know that this is paged on the Book, the great Record! We have blundered into science, Lord, enough to wake us up, for realities to know that every move that we make goes around and around the world, the same time we make it. We’ve got that through television. We do realize, Father, that that television doesn’t manufacture a picture, it only channels the vibrations into a tube that makes the picture. Even the color of clothes that we’ve got on, shows through the ether waves of the air, that vibration around the world. Then how is our sisters with them clothes on, acting like that, and not even hungering; painted faces, cut hair? Ministers that would go to theology, some seminary, “And take the things of man’s word, which makes, by their traditions, makes the commandments of God of no effect upon the people, by their traditions,” saying they should belong to church, and that’s all. O God, do they realize that every word we say, scientifically proven, it’s on a record? And it starts when we start living in this earth. It ends when we die, and it’s put in God’s album, to be played back again at the Judgment. How are we going to escape it, the damnation of God, if the thing has been made so clear before us and yet we turn It down? O dear God, these Words never die. They go on and on. The record will be played at the Day of the Judgment. You seen those hands that went up, Father. It’ll be right there at the Day of Judgment. Also, what their heart was thinking, will be there at the Day of Judgment. Now, Father, God, I ask You, as Your servant, I pray that You’ll take all the iniquity away from Your people. Iniquity: something that we know we should do, and don’t do it. David said, “If I conceive iniquity in my heart, God will not answer my prayers.” I pray, God, that You’ll take our iniquity, ’cause the Word is Your looking-glass that shows us of how short we are of being sons and daughters of the King. Father, I pray that You’ll do it, tonight. And make that an altar, ’cause the altar is setting full of people. And make that altar, there in the chair where they’re setting, make that heart of theirs the altar. May the world move off from every brother, sister in here. And may that little germ of Life, the gene of God that we just talked of, that attribute that came down from God, and has been manifested here to honor and glorify God. God, move the world from that. The others, I cannot pray, Lord, because “the sickness is unto death,” and there’s nothing there that causes them to move. But those who can move, and know that it’s wrong, clean their hearts and their souls, tonight, Father. And may they be filled with Your Spirit, walk in Your Light. Bless this dear, young, healthy, strong-looking pastor here, Lord. This young man, influenced, he said, by what he saw You do. This fine young man, O God, set his soul afire. Grant it, Lord. May he be a true shepherd, continually, all the time, to feed the flock which the Holy Spirit has made him overseer over. Grant it, Lord. May he not turn right or left, no way for no creed, no nothing else but the unadulterated Word of God come from his mouth, and That only. Bless him, God, him and his loved ones, and his little church here. Be with them all, Father. I commit this to You, Father. The Seed has been sown. May It fall upon that seed that was ordained to Life, and grow great, strong Christians for this assembly here, and other assemblies where they come from. Grant it, Lord. I commit it to You, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And, Father, “He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquity; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we were healed.” I seen moving through the door, a few moments ago, a poor nervous woman. And, O God, into her own family, what great things has been done, how You have manifested Yourself! I pray, God, for that woman. Take away all that back past, of life, Lord, and heal her tonight. Will You, Lord? Take her to You. See it, little children setting here, Lord, needing healing, others. I pray that You’ll heal them, Father. Grant it. May Your great healing power come and heal us, both soul and body. And now, to you now who are in the church here, or outside, that needs healing, I want you to raise up your hand, say, “I need healing, Brother Branham.” Looks like everybody does. All right. Will you believe me to be a servant of Christ? Say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Then, I want you to lay your hands over on one another. Just lay your hands over on each other. You raised your hands, that’s inside or out, you raise your hands, that you were believers in God. Jesus Christ said, His last commission to the Church, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth … He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe; in My Name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; if they take up serpents or drink deadly things, it won’t harm them; but, and if they’ll lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover.” Now, Jesus said that. Remember, He said that. That has to be. He wouldn’t have said that ’less there’s going to be somebody could catch that Word. Just like the womb of Mary could catch the germ, “A virgin shall conceive.” Like a palm tree could be created, an oak tree on a hill, His Word did it. His Word can catch into your heart right now. “I am a believer, Lord. This man or woman I got my hands on, they’re suffering. I’m not praying for myself. Because, they’re praying for me. I’m praying for her, or for him. And, O God, heal him, heal her. And I am a believer, and now we’re assembled. We’ve just been taught that we were with Christ when He walked on earth, for we are part of His Word. We suffered with Him. We bled with Him. We died with Him. We was buried with Him. We are risen with Him, and we’re setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. The great King setting here in our midst, and I am a son or a daughter of this King. And I have my hand laid on a son or a daughter of the King, that’s praying for me, and I’m praying for them. Now, Lord, answer my prayer, and heal this son of God or this daughter of God.” Together, let’s pray now for one another. Lord Jesus, we humbly come, confessing our wrongs. We come, confessing that we are worthy of sickness and death, and sorrow, but we are accepting Your propitiation for our sins and our sickness. And, tonight, these sons and daughters of God, setting here, hear the correction of the Word, and raising their hands, and wanting a closer walk. They laying hands on one another now because they believe Your Word to be true. They believe that we’re now risen with Christ, setting in Heavenly places with Him. They got their hands on one another, praying one for another. You said, “The prayer of faith shall save the sick, and God shall raise him up; and if he’s did any sin, it shall be forgiven him. Confessing your faults one to another, pray one for the other, that you might be healed. For the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much.” O Eternal God, hear the prayer of Your servants. And now, it’s written again, “If the people, that’s called by My Name, shall assemble themselves together, and pray; then I’ll hear from Heaven.” O God, hear the prayer of Your children tonight, from Heaven. Send down the Holy Ghost upon this audience, like a rushing mighty wind. And we bring these people before God. Satan, you are defeated. You are a defeated being. Jesus Christ conquered you at Calvary. You have no power. You’re a bluff. We’re calling your hand, tonight. In the Name of Jesus Christ, come out of this people here, you sickness and diseases. And may they go, free, in the Name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Hallelujah! Feel the glory of God! Feel your prayer answered. You believe God answered the person setting by you? How many believe it? Raise up your hands. [Congregation rejoices] There you are. Oh, wonderful! I love Him, I … With your hands up now, sing it to Him, with all your heart. Because He first loved … Do you mean it, with all your heart now? How many of you feel that God has forgiven your iniquities, the things that you’ve done? “And from this night on, O Lamb of God, I promise to walk upright. I’ll walk in honor of the Name that I’m called, a Christian, Christlike life. I’ll raise my hands, God. I dedicate myself anew to You, tonight. I’ll walk in the Light.” Amen. We’ll walk in the Light, beautiful Light, Come where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. We’ll walk in the Light, It’s such a beautiful Light, It comes where the dewdrops … Where He’s gone to prepare a place for us. Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Come, all ye saints of Light proclaim, Jesus, the Light of the world; Truth and mercy in His Name, Jesus, the Light of the world. What will we do then? We’ll walk in the Light, such a beautiful Light, Comes where the dewdrops of mercy are bright; Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Oh, don’t you feel all scoured out, feel good? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Oh, my! Let’s shake hands, as we sing again. We’ll walk in the Light, such a beautiful Light, Comes where … (God bless you, brother.) … of mercy are bright; Shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Let’s just close our eyes and hum it. [Brother Branham and congregation begin to hum Jesus, The Light Of The World] We’ll act like children. We are children. Oh, it’s such a beautiful Light, And It comes where the dewdrop of mercy are bright; Oh, shine all around us, by day and by night, Jesus, the Light of the world. Don’t you love Him? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calva- … Just close your eyes and sing it. Worship in the Spirit. Saviour Divine; Now hear me while I pray, Take all my sins away, O let me from this day Be wholly Thine! While life’s dark maze I tread, And grief around me spread, Oh, be Thou my Guide; Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow’s fears away, Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside. Oh, my! I know I’m just an old-fashion guy. I like … I think that’s got all the new, chopped-up, fandangoed, rock-and-roll impersonations beat, a million miles. Them old poets that wrote them songs, the Holy Spirit touched that pen, begin to write. Oh, my! I think of Eddie Perronet and all them; great! Fanny Crosby: Pass me not, O gentle Saviour, Hear my humble cry. One time they was trying to get her. She didn’t do like the Pentecostal Elvis Presley, sell her birthrights for a mess of Cadillacs. She … Come to her and wanted her to write worldly songs. She said, “I would not do it, for nothing.” Said, “Why, you’re blind. When you get to Heaven, how will you know Him?” She turned around, inspiration, so she said: I shall know Him, I shall know Him, And redeemed by His side I shall stand; I shall know Him, I shall know (How?) By the prints of the nails in His … Otherwise, “If I don’t see Him, I’ll feel His hand.” I shall know Him, I shall know Him, And redeemed by His side I shall stand; I shall know Him, I shall know Him By the print of the nails in His hand. Don’t it make you love Him? Gone to prepare a place for us! “And if I go and prepare a place, I will return again, to receive you unto Myself.” Little children in travail now, re-obey the commandments of God. And pastor, here, if none of you has been baptized, the water will be ready. And membership for the church, or whatever you want to do, or whatever, you do it. You haven’t got the baptism, the Holy Ghost, this is the night to receive It. Don’t you believe that? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] “Oh,” you say, “Brother Branham, it’s late. You done preached too long.” Paul preached all night, one night, this same kind of Message. And a little … A young man fell off of the wall and killed himself. And Paul, so anointed with that same kind of Message, laid his body upon him, and the life come back into him again. He is still “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever.” Don’t you love Him? [Congregation says, “Amen.”] Let’s just, once more, with our hands up, “I love Him. I love Him.” Where’s the pianist? There, if you will, sister, ever who it is. Give us the little chord, if you will. How many love Him? Just raise your hand. Say, “I really love Him. I just love Him, with all my heart. I love Him.” Now let’s just sing it, to the glory of God. Now, with our eyes closed, our hands up to Heaven, “I love Him. I love Him.” We’re worshipping. When you preach, and cut, and tear, and pull like that, this is the balm that God pours in, just heals. “There’s a Balm in Gilead, for the soul.” Let’s sing it now. Give us the chord. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s tree. And if … “This will all men know that you’re My disciples, when you have love, one for the other.” That’s right. If we can’t love one another who we do see, how we going to love God Who we can’t see? I love Him. [Brother Branham speaks to a brother on the platform] God bless you. [The brother says, “Being here tonight is a real honor from Heaven.”] Thank you, brother. [“It’s really nice.”] Now, I think the church, every one, was strengthened. Don’t you? [“Yes. Really.”] God bless you, Brother Boone. I’ll turn the congregation to you. God bless you. 
Let’s bow our heads. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight because that You answer prayer for us. This poor dear woman laying there, where surgery has failed. But, O God, we remember the first surgery was ever performed in the earth, You did it Yourself. You taken from the side of Adam, a rib, closed up the incision, and made a wife. O Father, I pray tonight that Your hand will come down now and will perform this great thing that we’re asking for. And these others, Lord, this woman that’s suffering with mental oppression, all others who’s got requests, we just commit them to Thee, Father, with our whole heart. In the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Indeed a privilege to be here tonight and have this fine audience to look at. And fine singing, the wonderful little choir. I was just thinking the difference, seeing them boys standing there with … clean-looking fellows, clean haircuts. I was thinking, last night, of—of the place where I’m staying; a bunch of hoodlums came in down there and trying to drown a boy in the swimming pool; they had to call out something and get them out of there. What a difference, see kids standing, singing the Gospel songs; what a difference. Thinking, as Brother Henry said there, “those man with them hair like the women should have,” you see. That—that—that’s right. Look like the … I see these boys trying it, have that hair, they even put these roller-curlers in it, around their face. And I don’t know, I … sometimes I become discouraged. It looks like it—it’s a true time of perversion. Men are trying to wear women’s clothes, and women wearing men’s clothes. And men leaving their hair like women, and women having hair like men. What’s the matter with this people, anyhow? Has the, really, the very threads of decency and honor left this nation and these people, this world? This is a horrible time, but it’s the most glorious time in the world, to preach the Gospel. If I could’ve stood on the brink of time before it come into existence, and the Father would have looked at me, and said, “What time down through these ages would you want to preach?” I’d want it right now, that’s right, just before His Coming. Looking out upon the audience, setting here before us … A minister friend of mine, in Tucson yesterday, was riding a horse. (Thinking of this man with this—this woman with the disc in her back.) This horse threw him. Another man called me at one o’clock this morning, to my hotel, and said, “The man’s at Veterans Hospital, and his eyes are glassy, his back smashed, his kidneys are pushed out, and his heart’s about to fail.” And there I got down on the floor, on my knees; telephone, got him on the other end, and prayed for him. And here he sets here tonight, setting right there. That was last night. Bob, would you just stand up there? There’s the man, right there. [Congregation applauds — Ed.] God answers prayer, morning, night, noontime, midnight, or anytime. Now, I—I am such a long-winded preacher, as they call it. I just kind of hate to get started this time of night, and—and I thought I’d just come over. The other night, why, we was speaking over here at a certain place, and the … fifteen minutes after I had been on, the people was picking up the dishes and motioning to me, “Quit! Shut up, you got to get out of here,” smoking cigarettes, and carrying on. It wasn’t the—the banquet’s fault, it was the people that we had it rented from. And the—the chairman’s wife went around and told the manager, said … Said, “Well, you’re supposed to be out of here at 9:30.” Said, “You never put that in the contract.” This lady, tonight, she come down here (real nice lady) and she said, “We understood that you want it,” said, “just take it as long as you want.” So that … So I’m very thankful for that. That’s very fine. Brother Henry, I certainly appreciate your—your kindness of inviting me here, and this chapter. I had the privilege last night of being down here at the Assemblies of God where I believe a Brother Boone is pastor. Had a wonderful time down there with that group of people. And tomorrow night we’re going somewhere over here, I don’t know where it’s at, and it’s another chapter. They take care of that; I just keep praying, reading, and going along, and it’s about all I can keep up with. But, now, we’re seeing strange things in this day. Now I’ve remember the last time I was here was in a tent meeting. I remember of speaking of it last night, of a little couple that brought their dead baby in. It—it’s up somewhere up here, they drove all day and night. The little mother setting, sad, holding that little baby in her arms. Now, she may be setting right here now, for all I know. And she … the little husband, couple of more couples with them, and they was … And she said … asked me if I’d come over (the man did) to the car. I took the little baby out and was just holding it; a little, dead, stiff, cold form; and I started to pray. And when I prayed, that body begin to feel like it was getting warm. So I just … I kept on praying. He started kicking and moving, going along, so I … started crying. I handed it back to the mother, she went on back home with it. So, they might not even been Christians, for all I know. See? That was wonderful. But what I’m thinking about, tonight, I know a church that’s dying, too, it’s our Pentecostal people. We got to shake out of this, uh-huh, that’s all. And the only way you’re going to do it is prayer and lining up with the Word of God. It’s the only way we’re going to do it. There’s only one way out, He’s that way, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Would we want our church get in the condition as he said over there, like in England? That’s the reason I’ve been, you think, so rude, bawling you out. And I don’t mean to do that, but I don’t want to see the church get in that kind of a shape. You don’t want to be in that shape. You—you’ve just got to drive It down so hard till you nail It and make It clench. It’s got to be done. So now, tonight, I’ve just got a … some Scriptures and text here I want to speak on for a while. I ain’t going to say no certain time. You get tired, why … I may be through in thirty minutes, and just depends on … I always just kind of leave it to the Holy Spirit, just whichever way He leads. Let’s bow our heads just a moment longer, speak to the Author before we open His Book. Almighty God, the Author of this Book, through Jesus Christ we pray. We are thankful for what we’ve already heard tonight. If we should—should punctuate this meeting by saying, “Amen,” and go home, it was good to be here, for we know that You’ve been with us. And, Father, as we open this Word now, speak to us directly out of this Word, that we might know the hour that we’re living. If we know the hour we’re living, then we can prepare for that hour; but if we go in blindly not knowing what or where, then we don’t know how to prepare. So, Father, we pray that You’ll let us see the Ark there, and the Door, open, and the Message calling us in. Grant it through Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. In the Holy Scriptures, I want to read a text here; found over in the Book of St. Luke, at the 24th chapter, the … I’m going to begin at the 13th verse, and read a portion of It. And, behold, two of them went the same day from the village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore—score furlong. And they talked together … these things which had happened. And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and … Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. And he said unto them, What manner of communication are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad? And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and has thou not known all these things which have come to pass … in these days? And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: And how the chief priests and the rulers delivered him to the … be condemned to death, and have crucified him. But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. Yea, and certain of the women also of our company made us astonished, which were … at the sepulchre;  … when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said unto them … which said that he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but he they … but him they saw not. Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe (not to believe) all that the prophets have spoken: Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and … entered into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them … all the scriptures the things concerning himself. May the Lord add His blessings to the reading of His Words. Now I take … if I call it a subject, I’d like to take this: The events … Modern Events Are Made Clear By Prophecy. Now, it’s always been God’s … the unchanging God’s way to fore- … let His people foreknow before certain events happen. If the people in the days of the Lord Jesus would have only have sought God and knowed what was just about to take place, they would not have condemned Jesus to death. But the reason it was, because the Scriptures had to be fulfilled, because the Jews had to be blinded. We all are aware of that. Do you realize that that’s promised again in this very age that we’re living? The Laodicean Church Age, this seventh church age that we’re in now, is naked, miserable, blind, and don’t know it. The same as He blinded them back there for the purpose of getting His Message through to the elected people, He’s promised to do the same thing today. And if I’d say this to respects, and to all my brethren and sisters in Christ, one of these days somebody’s going to say, “Isn’t it written that these things should happen first?” And it’ll be the same way it was then, “Verily, I say unto you, he’s already come, and they had did what they listed to him.” When they asked Him, said, “Why, the scribes say, and the Scriptures say that—that ‘Elias must first come.’” They said that to Jesus. He said, “He’s already come, and you didn’t know him.” See? And that’s perhaps the way it’ll end up again. Now we want to be posted, to know what’s to take place for this age that we live in. God has lotted His Word to each age, so much to each age, and we must notice that one age cannot carry over into another age. It just won’t work. For instance, as I’ve said, I believe last night or … I’m constantly speaking, night after night, places, and sometime I make a remark the second time. I don’t mean to repeat myself. But I say this: What would … good would it have done Moses to try to preach Noah’s message? Or what good would it been … would have done Jesus to try to preach Moses’ message? Or what good would it done Martin Luther to continue on with the Catholic message? What good would it done Wesley to continue on with the Lutheran message? What good would it done Pentecostals to continue on with the Methodist message? Or what good will it do Pentecost to continue on when the Bride’s being called? See, we’re right up into the seed time, we’re here at the end time. Now, unless a corn of wheat falls in the earth, it abides alone. As the critic, as I’ve made remarks since the book come out, probably you got it here in your—your city, that German author that wrote one of the most critical articles. He’s an infidel. Course not … I’m not condemning him because he’s condemned me so; but, because, being an infidel, the book shouldn’t never be on the shelves. And he said, “A God that could set up and say He could open up the Red Sea and deliver His people, and then set with His hands across His stomach and see through the Dark Ages those Christians being tore to pieces by lions; those mothers with their hair saturated in tar, and hung onto crosses and burned; and their baby … expecting mothers, they’d split the stomach and gamble on the sex of the child; and set up and let it happen; people who was supposed to be servants of this God.” You see, the Scripture is inspiration. You’ll never be able to know the Scripture just by setting down and reading It from a theological standpoint, from an educational standpoint; it never has worked. I was speaking with a Baptist minister not long ago, he said, “Until we learn the correct Greek, until we … ” I said, “In the Nicaea Council, before that, they were arguing about the Greek words in the Bible.” You’ll never know It. The Bible is to be revealed by inspiration. That’s the only thing, the revelation. Jesus told Peter, “Upon this rock.” This rock of revelation reveals who He is. “Blessed art thou Simon, son of Jonas, flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father which is in Heaven has revealed this to you; upon this rock I’ll build My Church.” Not upon Peter, not upon Himself, but upon the spiritual revelation of who He was. And He is the Word! St. John 1, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Hebrews 13:8, “He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever.” Therefore we’re living in the day when the manifestation of the Word of God has to come to a different age than the Pentecostal age. And that’s right. Remember, you’ll … I’m an uneducated person; but you can’t beat nature, because God works in the continuity of nature. Just like, as I’ve said, the sun rises and sets; and goes through the day, and like a school age; and dies in the evening, to rise again the next morning. The trees let the sap down in the winter time, go into the roots, and come back in the spring. Notice, He likened It to a grain of wheat, the Bride, the reason that God had to let that go like that. That fine, real, genuine Church that was established on the Day of Pentecost, had growed and growed since the Day of Pentecost, into a great church, it had to fall into the earth in that Dark Age and be buried like all seed does. It had to die so it could come forth in the reformation again. It come forth in the person of a reformation, Martin Luther. And from there, just like a stalk of wheat coming up. The first thing comes up, there’s two little blades, then it keeps adding more blades. Up come Martin Luther, and then Zwingli, and on down, Calvin, and as they moved on. Finally it goes into a tassel. Now, that was John Wesley in the Wesley age. It had a pollen drop back. From there come the Pentecostal age, so close, just like a real grain of wheat if you look at the stalk. But if you’ll take that wheat and move it back, there’s not one grain in it at all, it’s only a shuck in the shape of a grain. But it’s set there for a purpose, to shelter the grain until … If the sun hits it like that, it’d kill it. It’s got to stay in there until a certain time, and all the Life leaves the shuck (as It left the stalk, left the pollen), leaves the shuck and goes into the wheat, and forms again just like it was down in the ground. Now, all of us know that whenever a message is given, in three years they form an organization. When they do that, it kills it right there; it did in the days of Luther, ’cause it did it in the days of Wesley, it did it in the days of Alexander Campbell, and all the rest of them, and it did it in the days of Pentecost. Exactly! See? You get to a place, each one gets starchy, and gets off, and they can’t receive new revelation. They’re settled down; and there they are, and there they die. And the Life goes right through that, and goes right on to make the wheat. And when the wheat comes, that Life that’s traveled through that wheat, the resurrection, brings the whole thing out; yes, brings up for the Rapture. Now, remember, this Message started first with Divine healing, performing miracles. Now, if God let that go through a ordinary church, just like we already had, then it wasn’t God. God don’t have to show off; He don’t—He don’t have to do these things, to entertain us, like we Americans are used to (entertainment), but He does it to attract the attention of the people, that He’s fixing to do something. Look at Him Hisself when He come. “The wonderful little prophet, the rabbi, the prophet of Galilee.” Why, His ministry was wonderful, He was welcome in every church. But one day He set down, said, “I and My Father are One.” “Oh, my!” That was out. “Away with such a fellow!” “Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.” “Why, he’s a vampire! Get away from such a person!” See? See, there was something had to follow that sign. See, something followed. The shuck held it, but now the shuck pulls away; it has to. And remember, twenty years has passed by and no more denominations has come out of it, and it won’t. We’re at the end of denominations, the wheat’s taken shape. But what’s the matter with the wheat now, you can’t … it must lay in the Presence of the Son, to ripen, before the combine picks it up. Now, the events that we see taking place, it’s absolutely showed in the Bible, of every age. We think we’re all out of cater, but we’re not, everything’s moving just exactly with God’s Word. Now, the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book. There’s no book like the Bible, because the Bible is God in word form. See? It’s … A word is a thought expressed. God’s thinking expressed It, His Words through the prophets; and they wrote the Bible, which is in word form. And Jesus called It, “a Seed.” And any seed will bring forth of its kind if it’s in the right condition, the right atmosphere. Now, this Book of … is a … This Book of prophecy, It—It is foretelling future events. Now, the Book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ. You don’t add to It or take from It, and every revelation must come by It. See, it must be the Word. So people say, “I had a revelation.” Yes, we know Joseph Smith and many had revelations and things, but was contrary to the Word. It’s got to come according to the Word if it comes from God, because it’s to vindicate or to prove God’s Presence. And He foreknew all these things, being … By His fore-knowledge He ordained, foreordained (it’s called in the Bible, “predestinated”) every age to its place, and every man to its place, and every messenger to its place. He is God, the devil ain’t pulling nothing over on Him. And He’s God, and He has ordained everything to take place, and falls just exactly in line with His Word. So if we can see, by His Word, what age and what time we’re living, you’ll see it right here in the Bible, of this age, what we’re supposed … what’s supposed to take place at this time. Now, the—the other books, we find lots of books that they call “sacred books,” and so forth. And I’ve read the—the Koran and many others. But, you see, their—their sacred books are only a code of ethics, of morals, or of theology. But this Book is a Prophet, It’s a different from any other book. The Bible is the Word of God foretelling the future. It foretells because It’s forewarned. If God sends anything, He says and promised in the Bible that He would do nothing upon the earth until first He revealed it to His servants the prophets. That’s Amos 3:7. He … and God cannot lie. He reveals It, that’s been His way of doing it all down through the ages. He’s never failed to do it. Now, we are promised, in the last days, for this to be restored. There’ll be no—no church, no denomination, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, they’ll never (in their modern conditions) ever take this church to a Bride. They can’t do it, they fail. They’re too much at one another’s throats, and worldliness has creeped in, and so forth, and—and they died right in their tracks. And so God knows that. And to reveal this Word, one say, “Well, I got this. And bless God, It’s like that.” That’s just the way it was when Jesus came the first time; everyone has a doctrine, everyone has this. It’ll have to be something sent to us from God. And God’s promised it. And the only way He’ll do, is—is keep His same pattern. He promised to send us, in this last days, according to Malachi 4, a prophet upon the earth, “That would turn the hearts of the people back, the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers again.” He promised that in His Word. Luke 17 and many other places that He promised it, that He … what He would do in these last days to bring this thing to a vindicated Word. See, a man can say anything, but ’less God interprets that Word … See, now, we have our own interpretation, we say It means this. And this one, Methodist, says this, the Baptist says this, the Pentecostal said this, the Oneness says this, the Twoness says this. And, oh, my, there you are. But God don’t need no interpreter, He’s His Own interpreter. He interprets His Own Word by vindicating It in the age that It’s purposed for, the age that It’s given for. We’re not living in a Pentecostal age, we’re living in another age. See, we’re not living in a Methodist age, we’re living in another age. We’re living on up here to the Bride age, the calling out of the Church and getting It together for the Rapture. That’s the age that we’re now living. To my honest opinion that’s exactly the Truth. And this Book is a book of prophecy. Its believers are commanded to honor It and to read It, and believe Its Author, for every Word that’s written in there must come to pass. Everything that’s been promised has to come to pass, because It is Jesus Christ in each age. The same yesterday, it was Jesus Christ, was in Noah; it was Jesus Christ in Moses, it was Jesus Christ in David, it was Jesus Christ in Joseph; it’s Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever. And it’s Jesus Christ among His people today, doing the things that He promised He would do in this age. It’s Jesus Christ. But the church has become so starchy, so far away, like the brother said here. And—and our churches are becoming the same way, until we’ve got to have something to shake us back to the Word. How do we know it’s going to do it? It’s got to come according to God’s Own plan. It cannot come by layman, it will not come by the businessman, it cannot come by churches. God has laid down His plan. I spoke here in Shreveport the other day, on a national broadcast across the nation, that, Trying To Do God A Service Without It Being God’s Will. David tried to bring the ark of God back into the house. He was anointed king. Why, he—he consulted his—his delegates, his captains of thousands, and ten thousands, and so forth. And they all said, “That’s the Word of the Lord.” And they consulted the priest, “That was wonderful.” And they all got so inspired, they shouted, they done every religious act that was. And it was absolutely contrary to God’s will, because there was a prophet in the land by the name of Nathan and he wasn’t even consulted about it. See? And we found out it didn’t work though they were sincere, trying to do God a service. And you can be ever so sincere; but, until we know what we’re doing, you’re fighting at the air. Come back into the Word of God and get lined up, and then go; then you know. Like a—a soldier, don’t know what to do until he gets orders to do it. We must be Christian soldiers, and get orders from the Bible for the hour now; not the charge yesterday, the charge the day before, but the charge today (which way we go). Find out the hour that we’re living in. These modern events is slipping by us too swiftly, and one day we’re going to find out we’ll be left behind without nothing, and be caught, sealed into the mark of the beast before we know it. Now, and with patience we have to wait for this, for the prophecies that’s promised, every one of them must be fulfilled in its age. For It foretells us, the Author has before done this, and we wait to see Him do it again. What a time it is that we’re living in! Something like a—a calendar; you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you’re living in, and you look at God’s Bible to see what age we’re living in. We’re not living in the Methodist age, the Baptist age. We’re living in the Bride age, the calling, bringing back to God through a channel that He promised to bring it back in. He promised to do it. But as it’s been in every age, people let man put their own interpretation to It by theology, and will not believe God’s Divine vindication of It (that’s, God’s interpretation); not what I say, what somebody else says; but what God has promised and what God does, proves that it’s God doing His Own interpreting of His Word. They told you Pentecostals, forty-five, fifty years ago. Your mothers and fathers, when they were genuine pentecostals, come out of a organization and cursed the thing and walked out of it. Then like a dog to its vomit, went right back in it again. Done the same thing that killed that church, you killed your own by the same thing. Nothing against the people in there, nothing against it, it’s the systems of the thing that’s what’s doing it. Home, I’m … go home … I don’t preach this in other man’s meeting. I’m going to preach The Trail Of The Serpent, and listen to it if you take the tapes. And, notice, they missed seeing the confirmation of the prophecies of God’s Word being fulfilled. If those priests … They had it fixed up just exactly the way the Messiah was going to come, they knowed what was going to take place. The—the Pharisees had their idea, the Sadducees, Herodians, and all, they had their ideas. But He come not … He come contrary to every one of them, but exactly with the Word. Jesus said the same thing was here: “If you would have known Me, you should have known My day. If you had knowed, you’d … You say, ‘Well, Moses! We have Moses.’” Said, “Why, if you would believe Moses, you’d believe Me; because, he wrote of Me.” But, see, when God was confirming exactly what He promised, they had it in some kind of a dignified way that Jesus was supposed to come, and the … I mean the Messiah. The Messiah had to come right to their group or he wasn’t Messiah. Well, it’s that way, almost, today, “If you don’t see through my glasses, you’re not looking at all.” See, and so that’s—that’s just the way it—it is. We … That’s the truth. We hate to think that, but it’s absolutely the Truth. In Hebrews 1:1, God in sundry times wrote the Bible by His Own chosen way. He never wrote It by theologians, neither does He interpret by theologians. There never was a time that—that the theologians ever had an interpretation of the Word of God. The interpretation comes only to a prophet. And the only way we’re ever going to get out of this mess is for God to send us that prophet, just exactly, the only way it’s going to be done. It’s been believed, watched for, and—and fulfillment. See, It was not wrote by man, but It was wrote by God. It’s not a man’s book, It’s not a theologian’s book. It’s the Book of God, which is a Book of prophecy wrote by the prophets and interpreted by the prophets. The Bible said, “The Word of the Lord comes to the prophets.” Exactly! How beautiful that was illustrated, or, demonstrated when Jesus was come on earth, and John was the prophet of that day, and he—he was prophesying. They said, “Oh, you mean to say that God’s going to tear down our big associations here and all these things? And there’s going to be a time, when our—our temples won’t no more be worshipped in?” He said, “There was coming a time when God would make a sacrifice out of the Lamb of God, a man.” And he said that—that he would know Him when He come. And he said … He was so sure of his message, he said, “He’s standing right among you now and you don’t know it.” He’s right among you and you don’t know it. And one day when Jesus walked out, John looked up and seen that sign above Him, he said, “Behold, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.” That same minute Jesus knowed then that He was vindicated before the people. Now, He was the Word, would we doubt that? The Bible said He was the Word, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” And here He is, the … Here’s the Word on earth (look! perfectly!) comes right out into the water to the prophet. That’s right, the Word always comes to His prophet. So we can’t expect It to come to theologians. We can’t expect It to come to denominations. It’s got to come God’s channel route that He foretold us about, and that’s the only way It’ll ever come. It’ll be hated, despised, rejected. When It does come, It’ll be throwed out to one side, and everything, but God’ll do it anyhow. It was rejected in Jesus Christ, it was rejected in John, it was rejected by Jeremiah, it was rejected by Moses. It’s always that way. But God moves right on in the way that He promised He would do it. Yes, sir, He never does fail to do it the same way. The man who’s seen the vision or heard His voice, never altogether understood It. In many cases he didn’t know, because he’s just an instrument of God. It’s God’s thoughts expressed through man’s lips; a thought, course, is a word expressed. God does His own choosing by His—His predestinated choosing. He done it in every age, He set forth the man for each age. Like with Moses, when he was to fulfill what He told to Abraham. Moses was born a proper child, he couldn’t help being that way. He was born that way because he was born for that purpose. And so we find out that God does that in every age. God does His own choosing by His own predestinated choosing, choose His prophets and things for the age; fixes—fixes his nature, the man’s nature, the man’s style of preaching, on their gift and all that he does, is meet the challenge of that day. God creates that man and sent him. And in His own mind, as I preached on last night, we are a germ of the gene of God. He knowed that man would be there at that age, before there ever was a molecule, or a light, or anything else in the earth. For you’re a gene of your father, and you were in your father, yet your father had no fellowship with you because he … You was in there, but you knew it not and he knew it not, but you was manifested that you might … that he might fellowship with you. And you being born again, you’re born of Eternal Life. And that’s the only one form of Eternal Life, and that’s God’s Life. Zoe, the Greek word is “Zoe,” only one form of Eternal Life. Then if you are a son of God or a daughter of God, you were in God all the time. But He knew what bed and time that you’d be planted. So now you’re made a creature, a son of God, manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour, the Message that’s coming forth in this time. That’s right! You done there before the foundation of the world. If it wasn’t … If you wasn’t chose that way, no matter how much you try to impersonate It, you’ll never make it. How can you get blood from a turnip when there’s no blood in there? That’s the reason I try to say about … People thinking we was … we’re hollering at women about short hair, and people telling me about saying those things, “You’re going to ruin your ministry.” Ruin a ministry that God Himself ordained? Far be it! And when people hear the Word of God … When a baby is conceived in the womb of a mother, when that one cell goes in there, another cell builds on top of that. It’s not one cell of a human, the next of a dog, and the next of a cat, and the next of something else; it’s absolutely, straightly, human being. And when a man is born of the Spirit of God, he don’t inject anything into his life, It’s unadulterated Word of God vindicated for that hour. He takes the full Word of God, he don’t put no creeds, nothing else into It. It’s purely unadulterated, God’s Word made manifest among us. Look in the Bible, you see where, what age we’re living in then, when you see these great things being made manifest. When God promised to do it, He always does it at the end of each age when the church is come to the turning place, and is turned from the Word back to sin and worldliness. Worldliness is sin. The Bible said, “If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God’s not even in you.” Speaking last night, I was speaking about the—the sacrifice that was offered, the Lamb. It was to be seven days, representing the seven church ages. There was to be no leaven found amongst the people, no leaven for seven days. That means that there’s nothing mixed with It, It’s unleavened, constantly. And we don’t want no creeds, leavens and things mixed with us. We don’t want world mixed with us. It’s got to be the unleavened Bread of God, the Word of God, the unadulterated Word of God, which, “Man shall live by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.” Our denominational systems, and differences and things, has put leaven in us, and this and that and world and fashion. And, oh, it’s got so it’s almost Hollywood everywhere. It’ll finally come till it’ll be like England there, a altar call will be ashamed. My! As brother said, “How can you get the fish in the boat?” That’s right. We’ve got to have the Gospel preached in Its fulness, with the power of God to vindicate that according to the promise of that age and prove that that’s exactly God’s will. Outside of That you’re just a church member, no matter how much you try, you try to do God a service. You might go to the stitch-and-sew party, you might be ever so faithful to church; but unless that germ of Eternal Life was foreordained in you, to be a son or daughter of God, you’ll grow up a deformed something; but never be a real, true son or daughter of God. Often give my little story of a little eagle. How the farmer set the hen one time, and he had … I hope it don’t sound sacrilegious to you. But a farmer set a hen, and she was … lacked one egg in having a setting. I doubt whether anybody here know what a setting eggs is, how much it consists of. But, anyhow, he lacked one egg, didn’t have enough. So he robbed the eagle’s nest, she had two eggs. And he put the egg under the hen. When that eagle was hatched amongst all them chickens, he was a funny bird. He couldn’t understand the clucking of the hen, didn’t talk like his … like he wanted to hear it talk. And she scratched in the barnyard, and eat from the barnyard, it wasn’t food for him. He was an ugly duckling among them. The hen would cluck and he didn’t understand it. She’d go this way and eat this and eat that, he didn’t understand it. So one day his mammy, or mother, rather, to you. I … In the South we say “Mammy.” So, anyhow, he … his—his—his mother knowed she had two eggs, and only one of them was there, she went after the other one. She circled every … crossed the country, and finally she flew over the barnyard. She seen him down there following that old hen. She screamed, “Junior! You’re not a chicken, you’re an eagle!” That sounded just right to him. Why? He was an eagle to begin with. And when a man or woman has set under creeds and cold, formal religion, if he’s ordained to be a son of God, and he sees the Word of God preached in Its power, and God vindicate It; he’s an eagle to begin with, he’ll run to It as sure as two two’s is four. He can’t help it, because his very nature loves the Word of God. I don’t care what anybody else says, when he sees the Word of God being made manifest, he flies to It because he was a little eagle. As they go on to say, he said, “Mama, how am I going to get up from here?” And He said, “Just make a jump, I’ll catch you.” That’s the only thing you have to do, is make one jump to your feet, one jump to God, one promise, “Lord Jesus, I believe You with all my heart. I believe the Message of the hour. I see It confirmed, and I know It’s right.” Jump to your feet, Mama will catch you. Don’t worry, you’re an eagle, she’ll be right there to get you. Now, we realize that we’re living in a tremendous time and a great time, but when the truths of this Bible, believers has seen that vindicated, the very vindication of It is the evidence that God is in It. Absolutely! It’s then that the promised Word, that God promised, is made known. The seed is bursted forth, and they see It and they believe It. Others just can’t see It, somehow they’ll set and look at It. You know, I’ve preached hard enough to—to … across this country, that it shouldn’t be a short-haired woman in the country. But, every time, when I come back, there’s more. What’s the matter? There’s something wrong! You know the Word says that! You say, “Well, that don’t make any difference.” It does make a difference! There’s a fine brother, said, “I’m going to lay hands on you, Brother Branham. I love you. You’re ruining your ministry.” Said, “You ain’t got no business telling them women about that.” Said, “Let the pastors do it.” I said, “They don’t do it though.” I said, “Now … ” He said, “Well, it’s not your business, you just pray for the sick.” I said, “Whose business is it, then? I was called to preach the Gospel.” Said, “I’ll lay hands on you and ask God to take it away, then.” I said, “You’ll let—let me lay hands on you, too.” See? And I said, “I’ll pray that God will open your eyes and you’ll see It.” So, that’s right! He said, “You ought to preach … The people believe you to be a servant, a prophet of God.” He said, “You ought to teach them women how to—to get great gifts and prophesy and things.” I said, “How can I teach them algebra when they won’t even believe their ABC’s, first?” See? That’s right. So you can’t do it. That’s just in every … That’s right. If you can’t do the common things, how you going to do the spiritual things? The natural things. Certainly! Brother, sister, it might sound like a joke, but It’s the Gospel! It’s the Gospel Truth. That’s right! Notice, we find today that people … There’s many people just can’t believe It, even Spirit-filled people. I’m going to give you one that’ll choke you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost don’t mean you’re going in, not at all, not on that, don’t have anything to do with your soul. That’s the baptism, see. Here’s the inside soul, in here, that has to come from God. But then on the outside you have five senses, and five out … inlets to your … contact your earthly home. The inside, you have a spirit, and in there you have five outlets: your conscience, and love, and so forth, five outlets to that spirit. Remember, in that spirit you can be baptized with the genuine Spirit of God and still be lost. It’s the soul that lives, that was ordained of God. Didn’t Jesus say, “Many will come to Me in that day, and say, ‘Lord, haven’t I cast out devils, done great, mighty works, prophesied, the great gifts of God?’” He said, “Depart from Me, you that work iniquity, I never even knew you. Many will come in that day.” Didn’t Caiaphas prophesy? He was a devil. We find out there … And them priests, them great man, was supposed to be great leaders in them days, with humility and everything else, but failed to see the Word of God Itself made manifest before them. We could just take a bunch of them I got wrote down here. How about Balaam? He was a … You say, “God changes His mind.” He doesn’t change His mind! When Balaam went out as a prophet, and went down there, a bishop, preacher, whatever you want to call him, he was a great man. But when he consulted God about going down there and cursing Israel; he didn’t like them to begin with. So when he asked to go, God said, “Don’t go!” Then they sent a dignitary, a bunch, some maybe of bishops or presbyters, or something, down, some more education, to persuade him. He went back and asked God again. You don’t have to ask God the second time! When God says it first, that’s It! You don’t have to wait anything. Rebekah didn’t wait to get the second order. They asked her, said, “Will you go?” “Let her say.” She said, “I’ll go!” She was firmly inspired of God. She become one of the queens of the Bible for acting upon the pulsation of the Spirit of God that moved upon her to receive what was absolutely the truth, and she believed it. Now we find out, Balaam, of course, he couldn’t see. He went out and looked upon the people, said, “Now, just a minute! We’re a great, big people up here, you’re just a scattered bunch.” You see? “And we all—we all believe the same God.” That’s true. They all believed the same God. They all worship Jehovah. Look at Balaam’s sacrifice: seven altars, God’s perfect number; the seven churches, see; seven rams, speaking of the coming of the Lord. Fundamentally, he was just as fundamental as Moses was; but, you see, there wasn’t a Divine vindication. In there, they were both prophets. But under Moses’ ministry, there was a supernatural Pillar of Fire, a Light that hung with the camp. There was Divine healing, there was a shout of the King in the camp, great signs, Divine healing, and wonders and things performed among them. It was a sign of a living God among His people. Fundamentally, they was both right. And Balaam tried to persuade the people, and bewitched them into it. When? Just before they reached the Promised Land. Another day or two, they’d been in the Promised Land. But now I’m afraid … This is a hard mark to make, some of these days I’ll be shot for It. But remember this, that, the churches are being bewitched by this Ecumenical Council, he’s taking you right into it, to say “You’re the same group.” You’re not the same group! Come out from among that stuff and be separated! Certainly is, It’s true. We’re to keep away from that stuff, as far as you can from it. Balaam said, “We’re … let’s let our children marry together because, after all, we believe the same God.” “How can two walk together ’less they be agreed?” How can you walk with God ’less you agree with His Word? How can you add creeds and so forth to It, when you’re ordained not to do it, or, commanded not to do it? You can’t do it. There’s no way of doing it, brother, sister. You can’t mix that leaven with the unleavened. Oil and water will not mix. Darkness and light will not mix. Light’s so much powerful, it just puts the darkness out. And so we cannot mix it together. Neither can you mix sin and the world together. You can’t mix Church and denomination together. You can’t mix Church and creed together. You can’t mix the world and the Gospel together. It won’t mix! “Come out from among them, be ye separated,” saith God, “I’ll receive you to Myself. You’ll be My sons and daughters, I’ll be God to you.” We can never do it until these things are manifested, and the Word of God for the hour is proved to be the Truth. Follow in the footsteps. Pentecost, that’s why Luther lost his message. That’s how Wesley lost his message. See, if the Wesleyan church would have went on, they’d been Pentecostals. If the Lutherans went on, they’d been Methodists. See? Now if the Pentecostals go on, it’ll be the Bride. If you hang back and keep going back in the world like you’re going now, you’ll be lost! It’ll only be the shuck, and the stalk is to be burned. We know that. He will gather His wheat into the garner. But the husks He’ll burn with unquenchable fire, although it was a carrier. It certainly carried It. But the Life left it as soon as it become a leaf, it went on out to make something else until it come to its full statue. And so will the Church come through Justification, Sanctification, Baptism of the Holy Ghost (restoration of gifts), right on into the formed image of Christ. Christ is the Bridegroom, the Church is the Bride, and the Bride is a part of the Bridegroom. It’ll have to be a Word Church, not a denominational church. It’ll be the Word Church, the Word that’s made known, and by the vindicated Word of God. Balaam, he couldn’t see the difference. Many can’t. Pharaoh couldn’t see It, though It vindicated right before him. Dathan couldn’t see It. Dathan come out there, and he seen Moses and knowed. He went out there, said, “You try to think you’re the only one in the bunch. The whole congregation is holy!” God never did deal like that. He ought to have knowed better than that. And he said, “Well, the whole congregation is holy. You try to make yourself … ” If we’d say it today, the street expression, “The only pebble on the beach.” And Moses knew that God had sent him down there for that. He just said, “Lord … ” fell in the—the doorway of the tabernacle. And God said, “Separate yourself from him.” And He swallowed them up. And remember, the sin that Israel did (by Balaam saying, “They’re all the same.”), that sin never was forgiven Israel. And look, let me give you a striking figure; out of two million that left Egypt, two of them went into the Promised Land. Every one of them eat the same thing, they all danced in the Spirit, they all had everything in common; but when it come to the separated time, the Word done the separating. So is it today! The Word done the separating! When it come time, he said, “Why, here, we’re. . .” So close, look, the Bible said, “In the last days the two spirits,” Matthew 24:24, “would be so close, it would deceive the very Elected if it was possible.” That shuck looks just exactly like the wheat, but it ain’t the wheat. See? It isn’t the wheat, but it looks just exactly like it. See? So close, it would deceive the very Elected. You denominated and fall into that denomination, and dry up and die, and the wheat moved right on out through the … See? That’s exactly right! It’s a carrier, but not the wheat. Remember, the wheat just keeps going on. In the resurrection all that strength of the wheat will come right up into the wheat, as it goes to make the head, to come out in the great resurrection. Never forgiven! Let’s stop here just a moment. I hope I don’t choke you out. But, look, let me ask you something. Let’s just take that. Say, for instance, this count would be right. When the sperm from male and female come, if you ever known test tubes or—or hybreeding and so forth of cattle, you’ll find out that the discharge from the male puts out about a million germs. And the discharge from the female puts out a million eggs. But did you know there’s only one of them that’s fertile? Them little calves, or whatever they are, in these millions of germs, a million germs, there’ll be that one little germ will work itself up among the rest of them germs and go right over and find that fertile egg and crawl into it, and the rest of them die. One of them is ordained to life, the others are not, though they’re all the same. One out of a million! What if it would be that way tonight? There’s five hundred million, supposed to be, I think, Christians in the world, about that figure, just a round figure. If the rapture would come tonight then, in the living going, there’d only be five hundred people. Well, there’s that many missing any day, almost, that they can’t ’count for. The Bride will be taken away and we’d wonder what it’s all about; and the people going right on preaching, saying they’re “getting this, and that, and the other,” and look what a deception that would be. Say if it would be that; I don’t say it is, I don’t know, I’m no authority of that. God’s the Judge of that. But look how easy it could happen, in all figures and things, how it could be proven. Why didn’t Korah see That? Why didn’t Dathan see That? Why didn’t Ahab see It? When Ahab … When Jehosaphat went down to Ahab, he said, “Ahab, we’re in trouble. Do you know God gave us this land, Joshua divided it up? You know this piece of ground up here that the Syrians taken, isn’t that our ground?” “Yes!” “Our children’s hungry, and the Syrians (our enemy) are feeding their children’s, filling their bellies with the wheat that ought to be ours.” That’s scripturally right. Said, “Will you help me to go up there and take that?” Now, sometimes a good man under the influence of evil will give in. Better watch, church, watch real close. Now, the first thing you know, Jehosaphat, being a great religious man, he said, “Well, we should go up, sure, to our church, we’re all the same people.” But they wasn’t the same people! No! He said, “Well, our church is your church, our people is your people. Sure, we’ll go,” he said, “but let’s consult the Lord first.” So he said, O Ahab, “No doubt, we should have thought of that. Well, we’ll … ” “Is there a prophet of the Lord?” Said, “I got a seminary full of them. I got four hundred down here, the best ones there is. They all got their Ph.D., L.L.D., their double L.D.’s, and everything else that goes with it. They’re every one … ” Now remember, they were Hebrew prophets, from a school of prophets. Said, “Bring them up, let’s hear them.” Now, I believe it was Zedekiah (the great head over the bishop, all of them) come up there, and he had the inspiration. He had inspiration, absolutely. He come up there, and made himself two big iron horns. He said, “You know, THUS SAITH THE LORD, ‘You’re going to take these horns and push the Syrians plumb out of the country.’” Well, all the rest of them prophesied, “That’s exactly right!” Every one of them, the whole seminary, in agreement. See? Ahab said, “You see?” Jehosaphat, being kind of spiritual, you know, he hadn’t dried up altogether, he said, “But isn’t there just another one somewhere, that we could consult?” “What do you want to consult others, when the whole Ecumenical (the whole council), it says ‘It’s all right’?” (Excuse me, see.) “The whole thing said, ‘That’s what we ought to do.’” See? “That’s what we should do.” He said, “But isn’t there just another one somewhere?” That odd one, you know. He said, “Yes, there is. There’s one, Micaiah the son of Imla, but I hate him.” Always that way. “I hate him because he’s always just bawling our people out, and cursing me, and telling me all the evil about me. I hate the man!” Said, “Ah, don’t let the king say so.” Said, “Go get him.” So they went over there to the son of Imla, some of the—the bishops, or, some of the elders, and went over there, said, “Now, listen, do you want to get back in the organization again? You say the same thing that they say, they bring you back.” But there happened to be that God had a man that they couldn’t put their hands on him; God had His hands on him. He was just the reflector of God’s Truth. Said, “Sure,” said, “I’ll go down, but I’ll only say what God puts in my mouth.” There’s the man of God. He said, “Give me the night.” So the night come, and the Lord spoke to the prophet, little nobody. And first thing you know, he come out the next morning. Said, “What about it, Imla?” He said, “Go on up,” said, “but I seen Israel scattered like sheep on a hill, having no shepherd.” He said, “What did I tell you! What did I tell you about it! And he said … Then the big bishop walked up and slapped him in the mouth, said, “Which way did the Spirit of God go? Cause I know I had the Spirit; I danced in It, I done all these things. See, I—I had the Spirit on me. Which a way did It go?” Now, see, Imla being a son of God, or a real prophet of God, he examined his vision with the Word. If it wasn’t with the Word, it’s wrong. See? The Word for that hour, see. Now, he said scripturally, the land belonging to them, the land was theirs. Scripturally, everything seemed to be right but one thing. Remember, it was one Word that caused the whole mess to come, Eve disbelieved one Word of God; in the first of the Bible, one Word caused the trouble. Jesus, come in the middle of the Bible, said, “Man shall live by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.” At the end of the Bible, said, “Whosoever shall take one Word out or add one word to It.” It’s not part of the Gospel … The Methodists have part, the Baptists, Presbyterians, and so forth, they had part of It, Catholic had part of It, Jehovah Witness, all the rest of them. But It’s the whole Word, all the Word, the Word of the hour; what counts. And we’ll never do it until God anoints a prophet that can stand and tell It, and confirm It, and prove It that It’s right. It’ll slip right through the people, they’ll never know It, just like it’s always been. You Catholic, like Joan of Arc, you burned her at the stake for being a witch; later you dug up them priests’ bodies, two hundred years later, and throwed them in the river. You didn’t know Saint Patrick and the rest of them. It’ll go right through your hands again, the first thing you know. God will do it, and you’ll never even know it’s done. See, He just slips right through and gets His Bride and takes Her right on up, and steals Her away, right out of the midst of the people. We find out, this little Micaiah said he examined, he knowed that God had said, through a real prophet before him. The prophet before him, what did he say? He said this, he said, “Ahab, because you shed the righteous, or the blood of the righteous Naboth, the dogs will lick your blood also, and Jezebel.” And that’s just exactly, had to come to pass because God had said it. How could that prophet prophesy good when it was evil against it? How can I tell this Laodicean Church Age the good things when God spoke against it? You’re naked, miserable! You say, “I’m rich, I have better … I have churches like the Methodist, and the Baptists, and the Presbyterians. I have this, I have that; the best this, that, and the other.” That’s right, but don’t know that you’re naked, blind, miserable, to the real thing that God is manifesting. It’ll go right through you, like that, moving right out. See? Believe, people, before it’s too late. Now, we find out that he smote him in the mouth, and said, “Which way did the Spirit of God … ?” Micaiah said, “I seen God setting upon the Throne. And all … He called the delegates of Heaven, said, ‘Who can we get to go down and deceive Ahab?’” Said, “And one lying spirit come up and fell before God; a liar.” And remember, that lying spirit got into those prophets, they ought to have knowed then that the spirit was upon them wasn’t according to the Word. But they were so carried away because they were the king’s prophets, because they had everything fine. And that’s what the church has done today. You’ve got away from that old-fashioned experience you had years ago when you stood on the street corner and preached the Gospel. Come out of those organizations and call yourself “a free people!” Nay! because you’re wrapped in it again, like a hog to its wallow or a dog to its vomit. If it made him vomit the first time, it’ll make him vomit again. That’s right! God spew you from His mouth, He said, “You’re lukewarm, neither hot or cold”; have a few meetings, then play a few, music, and sing a little bit, when, it’s absolutely … it’s almost become a disgrace to Christianity. My son called me over the other day to look at a television, supposed to be singing bee where the people come. That bunch of little Ricky’s standing there, shaking around like this rock-and-roll, and singing them hymns, it’s a disgrace to Jesus Christ! There’s no more solemnity in the church at all. It seems like it’s all become a rock-and-roll something, and a fashion show, in the stead of the Church of the living God where Jesus Christ can manifest Himself in power. Seems to me, there is something wrong somewhere. They’re slipping away. And the Bible said it would be that way. See? Look where you’re at. Be careful, wake up before it’s too late. Now we find out, He said, “Who can we get to go out there and deceive Ahab, to get him up there to fulfill that prophet’s words?” See, if the prophet said a Word, heavens and earth will pass away but It can’t fail. It’s got to come to pass. So that’s what, it had to take place. He said, “Put this man in the inner jail, feed him of bread of sorrow and water of sorrow. When I return in peace, I’ll take care of him.” Micaiah stood there firm, knowing he had the Spirit of God. His prophecy, his visions was right. His Message was right, ’cause It was THUS SAITH THE LORD from the visions, THUS SAITH THE LORD from the Word. It had to be right, was THUS SAITH THE LORD. He said, “If you return at all, God never spoke to me.” And you know what happened, sure. See, you … Understand, brother. Listen. Sure, Caiaphas, he couldn’t see It. Why didn’t he look down … ? He was a—he was a bishop, he was a pope of all the churches together. Why couldn’t that man see Jesus standing there? Why couldn’t he understand? When they was singing the 23rd Psalm, the 22nd Psalm, rather, in the church, and, “My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?” and there He’s hanging on the cross. The very Scriptures, the very God that they were worshipping, they were condemning Him and killing Him for “a fanatic.” There it is. It’d shock you if I’d tell you that’s just about to repeat again. The Bible said He was on the outside trying to knock to get in, and nobody would let Him in, “He that I love I chasten and rebuke, I scold him, I shake him down, but it’s because I love him. Open up and let Me come in.” Yeah. Could not … “Remember, I didn’t want to get in the church; it’s he, the individual.” He couldn’t get in the church, had Him locked out. Only … then, only organization of all of them, is this church age, that He was on the outside the church. Put out! Refused! Rejected! Because … He was only manifested in temporarily in the other churches, in the form of justification, so forth; but in here, the age that’s coming now, is the full manifestation of the vindication of Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Oh, I’ll admit we got a lot of impersonators, but examine the first one, the original. Moses went down with the commandments of God, to deliver Israel; and when he did, he performed some miracles. The impersonators followed him. If they had been first, he would been the impersonator. See, he had the Word of the Lord, and the Lord vindicated; he just set still. And, you know, that same thing’s promised in the last days? “As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so will these man of reprobate mind concerning the Truth.” And when an organization keeps a … takes a man right down through that organization, it showed it did not come from God; because, God does those things to attract the people’s mind, and then the Message follows it. If it isn’t, then it’s not God. It’s not God! God always does that. Judas couldn’t understand It. He walked right with Him, he didn’t see It. But the real, ordained of God, that real gene, that real germ, a soul of God that was in God before the foundation of the world; remember, you that’s really got the Spirit of God in you tonight, you were here in Christ because He was the fulness of the Word. He was the fulness of the Godhead bodily. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself. Do you believe that? Look, He was in Christ. Then if you were in God, a gene, a word, a attribute from the beginning, then you walked with Him here on earth, you talked with Him on earth, you suffered with Him on earth, you died with Him at Calvary, and you rose with Him again; and now you’re setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, communing with Him (the Word) as It feeds into your soul, that, “Man shall live by every Word that proceedeth.” Not the Methodist word, the Baptist word; remember, if there was any left over in the sacrifice, it must be burned before morning, ’cause tomorrow’s another church age. That right? Exodus, It’s true. A symbol, type of the Sacrifice. The Door. Said, “I’ll make one place. Don’t … You won’t worship Me in every door that I’ve give you; but there’s one Door, and in that Door I’ll put My Name.” And where the Lord puts His Name, that’s the place that God will receive your sacrifice. We’ve made all kinds of doors, but God made a Door. God made a Door, and that Door was … Saint John the 10th chapter, Jesus said, “I am that Door.” God put His Name in Jesus. Do you believe that? He was the Son of God. Every son comes in his father’s name. He said, “I come in My Father’s Name, you receive Me not.” I come in my father’s name, you come in your father’s name. Jesus come in His Father’s Name, so His Father’s Name is Jesus; exactly, ’cause He came in His Father’s Name. “And you receive Me not. Another will come, and him you will receive.” You’ll take your denominations and go on with them. Just go ahead, the Bible said, “They were raised up to fulfill this place. Blind, naked, and don’t know it.” Church, religion, oh, very pious, just the same as Cain was; make a sacrifice, make everything just the same as Abel did. But by revelation it was revealed to him what the sacrament was, not fruits of the field and something to do with your hand. The believer can see the Word made flesh; the others cannot do it. All them Israelites, after they had seen Moses perform that and brought them right up to the great council, where it was to be held, every one of them said, “We’ll go with Balaam, because we think Dr. Balaam’s right. He’s smarter, is more educated, everything, so we’ll just take it.” And God never did forgive them, He destroyed them right there in the wilderness. And Jesus said, Himself, “They’ll never come, there’s none of them saved.” Jesus said … They said, “Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness for forty years.” He said, “They’re every one dead, Eternally separated from God. They’re every one dead.” Certainly! Because they listened to an error. When Moses, the vindicated of God, and a leader to show them the way to the promised land, and they had come so far all right, but then they wouldn’t go on with him. Now, believers can see It, but unbelievers cannot see That vindicated. Look how pious Caiaphas was. Look how all them priest how pious they was. And Jesus turned around, said, “You are of your father the devil, and his works you’ll do.” But there was a few believers setting there. Do you think them disciples could have understood when Jesus said, “I and My Father are one”? They couldn’t have explained It. When He said, “Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, drink His Blood, you have no Life.” Could they explain It? No. But they believed It, because they seen God being vindicated and made flesh. Jesus said, “If I do not the works of My Father, then believe Me not. But if I do the works of My Father, the Word that’s predicted for Me to do, then you … If you can’t believe Me, believe the works that I do, that you might be saved.” See? Jesus said, “My sheep know My Voice. They know My Word, they see It when It’s vindicated for that age.” “Well, Caiaphas knowed the Word too!” But not the Word for that age. He had the word of what the Pharisees had poked into him, but not the vindicated Word of the hour. “They know My Voice, they know My sign, they know My wonder.” How now, to … Oh, let’s get back to our text, ’cause we’re just going to miss a lot of this Scripture if we don’t, ’cause I got to close in the next few minutes anyhow, ’cause it’s going to be ten o’clock in a few minutes. I love Him. Friends, you people who walked down that aisle and put that offering in there a while ago; people that’s fed my children, put clothes on their back; the people that’s put your money (that you hard earned) in an offering plate, you know where that goes? That helps take me overseas to the heathens that never has heard anything about God. That’s what I do with it, every penny, God’s my Judge. Here’s some of my … the man’s setting right here now that’s in—in the treasury of my church. I get one hundred dollars a week, and that’s all; rest of it goes to sponsor overseas meetings where they can’t come. The churches won’t have me. They don’t want me. No. That’s right! They term me now, “He’s … ” They say, “He’s a ‘Jesus Only,’ or he’s something like that, or some heretic, fanatic, and all like that, a—a Jezebel.” And I—I look for that, they called my Lord, “Jezebel,” and they called Him … not a Jezebel, but a “Beelzebub.” They called Him all those bad names. “If they called the Master of the house, ‘Beelzebub,’ how much more will they call them of His disciples?” So that don’t make any difference. And you yourself, by the help of God, you think I’d stand up here, a big hypocrite, and tell you something … ? Or, wouldn’t I fall right in line with the thing if I thought it was from God? But if I love you and know what’s the Truth … Have you ever heard me say anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass? No. I ask anybody. There are thousands of things that’s been said, they all come to pass. Remember that time when Samuel was called out, I believe it was, and he said … ? Israel wanted to make themselves like the rest the nations. That’s what you Pentecostals are coming to. You want to act like the rest the people. You’re not them kind of people. Keep away from it. The big churches and big fine things, O brother, don’t do that. We preach the coming of the Lord is at hand, let’s get to the fields down there and notify the heathen. See, do something about it. But, you see, Samuel said, “Have I ever at one time taken any of your money from you for my living?” They said, “No, Samuel, you never done that.” Said, “Did I ever tell you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass?” “Oh, that’s right, Samuel. We believe you’re a prophet sent from God. Yes, sir. Everything you said come to pass, Samuel. But we want it anyhow.” You see what happened. O brother, the Scripture just keeps repeating Itself back and forth through the Scripture, ’cause it’s God’s way of doing it, you see. You see, you hit these kind of times. Let’s get to our text right quick. Now, I been all this time, and I ain’t even come to my text yet. It’s on my heart! I love you! Don’t perish with the world! If you’re of the world, you’ll perish with the world. If you’re of God, you’ll go with Him in the resurrection. So change your nature tonight from the love of the world and the things of the world, and all these creeds and things, and look straight to Calvary to your Sacrifice; meet Him there on them grounds, ’cause that’s the only place He’ll ever meet you. He … The Methodists says, “It’s in our church”; the Baptists says, and the Pentecostals, and this, and the Presbyterians, and this. But He said, “I’ll meet them in one place, the Place I put My Name.” That’s in Jesus Christ. That’s where God put His Name. That’s the only place He’ll meet you; and it’s Christ, is the Word, the same yesterday … It’s growed from the feet, thighs. And now it’s in the head, fixing to go; manifesting in full measure the Bride, the same as the Groom. Now let’s go to our text, right quick, for about ten minutes, and then we’ll close. Now our text, we all will want to consider it. It had happened again, as our text, as it usually has happened. God sent His prophet as He … Word had promised of Malachi 3, “A messenger I’ll send before My face to forerun His coming.” Now if you want to vindicate that, to prove it; Matthew, 11th chapter, vindicates the same. When the disciples of John came over and they seen Jesus, they said, “John is in prison.” Said, “We’ve come to ask You whether he … ” John’s eagle eye had been filmed over. And he was in the prison, he was fixing to die; said, “Go ask Him.” See, John said, “Oh, His fan’s in His hand, He’ll thoroughly purge His floor.” He thought the Millennium would start right then, he thought the grain was ready. But it had to die and go into the stalk, come up again to make the true Bride. So he said, “He’ll gather His wheat into the garner, and He’ll burn, the fire.” Watch that—that forerunner of Christ in that age, what he said would happen. “The grain … ” And I hope you’re not asleep. The grain is here! It’ll be gathered into the garner. It was that Bride, that part of it. But what did He say will happen to the stalk? It’ll be burned with unquenchable fire. Seek salvation now while you can. Be a grain, not a stalk. See? Go into the Life, not the old dead form; go into the Life of Christ, the Word made manifest, the … made manifest and vindicated so. This is the—this is the gathering time, the combine is coming. You’d better get into the grain, ’cause the shuck’s going to be left behind. Now, we find out it happened, Jesus … To finish my quotation here, this Matthew 11. See, He didn’t give John … He say, “Now, wait, I’ll give John a book on how to conduct himself, A Believer In Jail.” No! He said, “Stand around and watch what happens. Go back and show John what happens: the lame walk, the blind see, the dead’s raised up, and the Gospel’s preached to the poor.” Just exactly what the prophet said would come to pass. “And blessed is you who’s not offended in Me.” And his disciples started across the hill, He turned, said, “What went ye out to see when you went to see John? Did you go see a man that’s catering in soft raiments, and so forth, the turned-around collars, and all this, you know?” Said, “They’re in kings’ palaces, they kiss the babies and bury the dead, he don’t know how to hold a two-handed sword.” See? Said, “What’d you go to see? A—a reed that’s shaken by any wind, ‘Come on, John, I’ll give you more money if you come over here’? (‘Well, bless God, I ain’t Methodist no more, I’ll be Pentecostal, I’ll be Presbyterian, I’ll be this, that, the one with more money.’)” Said, “You never did see a reed shaken with the wind.” Said, “What did you go to see there, a prophet?” He said, “Yes, and more than a prophet.” John had just paid the poorest tribute he could to Jesus. Know it had to come that way; asked Him after he had introduced Him and seen that Sign above Him, he said, “This is the Messiah,” then he comes and asks, “Are you He, or do we look for another one?” But, look, Jesus knowing that, He turned and give him a tribute, said, “What did you go to see, a reed shaken with the wind?” Said, “There’s never been a man born of a woman as great as John, till this day.” That’s right! What a compliment to pay the man! But, you see, there it was, the prophecy had been fulfilled right before their face, with a forerunner coming, exactly what Malachi said. Now, that’s Malachi 3, not Malachi 4. John the Baptist was Malachi 3, Jesus said so. When they asked Him, said, “Why does the scribes say … ” Said, “He’s already come. They did what they said.” But, remember, Malachi 4, immediately after the Malachi 4 prophet, the fourth coming of John the Baptist in … or the … of Elijah. The fifth coming will be the Revelation 2, the witnesses, when he comes for the remnant of the Jews. But God has used that same Spirit five times: grace, J-e-s-u-s, it’s all been Jesus all the time; f-a-i-t-h, g-r-a-c-e, and so forth. You see? The number five is a grace number and He used it. Won’t use just three, won’t use just two, three, four. It’s five times He uses it. Now, notice quickly now, as we finish up. He said, “This is he who was spoken, ‘I send My messenger before My face.’” But in Malachi 4, immediately after that prophet prophesied, the whole earth is to be burnt over, and the righteous walk out upon the ashes of the wicked. See? Exactly! See, that’s the Malachi 4 prophecy. And notice in Luke 17, where He said, “In the last days, it’ll come like Sodom and Gomorrah again.” Have we got it? We got Sodom and Gomorrah again? The whole nations, look at it. Look what he just said about England, the whole thing is perverted. Even the food is perverted. And looky here what science … You see in Reader’s Digest, I believe it’s last month, they said, “Little boys and girls go through middle age between twenty and twenty-five years old.” I meet them in the meeting, little girls in menopause, and twenty, twenty-two years old, in menopause. What’s it lotted to? The perversion, hybreeding. That’s exactly what corrupted, the whole thing’s corrupted the body. We’re nothing but a mess of—of … just like a hybrid plant. You take a hybrid plant and set it out there, every germ will run right to it. But a genuine, original plant, a germ will go away from it, he can’t stand on it. And that’s what’s the matter with the church, we’ve hybrid it. That’s what’s the matter with Pearry Green’s old horse up there, and he throwed that boy the other day, he’s nothing but an old quarter horse. See? Only thing it is, he … It’s just like a mule, he’s—he’s … a mule don’t know who his papa or mama is, he don’t know nothing; he’s half mule and half horse, and half this and donkey; he don’t know what he is. You could never … He’ll wait all of his life to get to kick you. That’s right! You can call him, say, “Come on, boy. Come on, boy.” He’ll hold his ears up, and, “Haw! Haw! Haw!” See? Like some of these saying “Days of miracles is past, Haw! Haw! Haw!” these half-breeds, supposed to be church members and Christians. I ain’t saying that for a joke, but it’s the Truth. But a genuine, thoroughbred, brother, he knows who his father was, who his mother was, who his grandfather, grandmother was, you can teach him something, he’s gentle. And a genuine Christian that’s born of the Holy Ghost and filled with God’s power and Word, he knows who his father is, who his mother is, who his grandfather, grandmother was, he knows all about It. You can teach him something. But a half-breed, that’s what’s come to churches. Hybrid between the world and religious organizations, and putting a little Word in it here, a little Word there, just enough to deceive. That’s right. When you see the real Word of God being manifested like Caiaphas and them did, they turn away from It, they don’t know. Hybrid! Now we find out, and in this message, Isaiah 40:3 also vindicated John. He said, “A voice of one, a prophet, crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make His path straight.’” The church did not believe him, for he was not of their group. That prophet was raised out of a wilderness, come up knowing no one. He had the very Spirit on him that Elijah had: he was a man of the wilderness, he hated immoral women. Remember how Elijah … What caused his head to be taken from him? Was Jezebel. Jezebel was the cause of his death. It run him into the wilderness. John the Baptist, another wilderness-lover, a hunter, a woodsman. Watch him. He had no education. Watch his—his text, wasn’t like a theologian. He said, “O you generation of vipers!” The filthiest thing you can find in the wilderness, the sneakiness, was a—was a snake. And he called those priests, “You generation of vipers! Who’s warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Don’t begin to say, ‘We belong to this, and we have this or that,’ for I say unto you, God’s able of these stones,” wilderness. Also, “The axe” (what he used) “is laid to the root of the tree; and every tree that don’t bring forth good fruit, hewn down and cast into the fire.” Amen. He was a preacher of nature. A great man of God, lived a short time, but certainly set a blaze across the earth. He shocked that generation in them six months of his ministry. God raised him for thirty years, to get that six months out of him. But God does His own way, He knows what His harvest is. And we find out now that this is exactly what had took place. They didn’t believe him, because he wasn’t of them. They didn’t. They did as usual, they didn’t see It. They did not believe God’s Word of Malachi 3, or they would have seen plainly, by the letter, that this was that forerunner. They hadn’t had a prophet for four hundred years, and here one rises on the scene all at once. See? And the people, the believers, believed him to be that. See, they did not believe It. They did not believe, ’cause when they seen the letter completely confirmed, what He said He would do, and everything, and seen It clearly vindicated when the Word come right into the water to the prophet. There they stood. There’s many argue on that Scripture there about John. See, John said, “I have need to be baptized of Thee, and why comest Thou unto me?” Jesus said, “Suffer that to be so, for thus … but thus it’s becoming to us, behooving us (becoming) that we fulfill all right. John, you being a prophet, you know the sacrifice has got to be washed before it’s presented. And I am that Sacrifice, and you’re a prophet and know that.” Then he suffered Him and baptized Him. See? And he knew it was. Look, they laughed at him, called him “a wild, screaming, unlearned fanatic,” as usual, that prophet forerunning the first coming of Jesus. I don’t say that they’re … don’t have the same impersonations today of—of genuine. They do, they absolute. But, remember, where you see a bogus dollar there’s got to be a real dollar that’s made off of. Where you see one impersonating to be a Christian, there’s got to be a real Christian somewhere; because, if it wouldn’t, that would be the original. You’ve got to get to the original. But check the first one, and see if the original is just exactly with the promise. If it is, then believe It: the promise for the age. Then John’s prophecy was vindicated in God’s order. The Word came to the prophet and vindicated him truly as that person. Again Jesus came in a … different from their understanding of that prophecy. They didn’t understand It that way. (Now, we’re going down to the end now.) But according to the prophet’s Word, It was fulfilled to the letter. The prophecy is fulfilled; but the way they thought It would be, It wasn’t that way. Now, how could they have understood and knowed which was right or wrong? To see if it was vindicated by God, if it was God interpreting what He said. There had been false Jesuses raise up, and led a man, a bunch of … four hundred, out in the wilderness and things; but he never proved to make hisself in the Word, you see, like He said. Jesus, when He come, He was to be a prophet. That’s right! And today, before Jesus comes again, the full manifestation of the person of Jesus Christ is to be manifested in flesh. Think of it! Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man, when the Son of man is being revealed.” What is revealed? Unfolded, made known. The secret had been brought forth, revealed. In the day that the Son of man will be revealed, the world will be in a Sodom condition. We’ve got it, haven’t we? Yeah! How many believes that? It’s in a Sodom condition. And that’s exactly right! Look where it’s setting, now. Remember, there’s always three groups of people in every bunch of people you gather, that’s, make-believers, unbelievers, and believers. We have them in every group. They’ve had them in all time. There was the Sodomites, there was—there was the Lotites, and there was Abraham. The Abraham was a called-out group, he wasn’t in Sodom to begin with. Now watch their Message! They’d been looking for a promised son, looked for it for years. God had showed Abraham many great signs and wonders, but here God came down Himself like a man! You say, “That was an Angel.” Abraham called Him, “Lord,” capital L-o-r-d. Any reader of the Bible knows that that capital L-o-r-d is Elohim. “In the beginning God,” Lord God, Elohim, the all-sufficient One. Abraham called Him, “Lord God, Elohim.” Now notice, there was two people that went down into Sodom with a message, and they preached to the Sodomites. They didn’t perform nothing, but blinded them; which, preaching the Gospel does blind the unbeliever. But watch what kind of a sign the Abraham group received! Now, we are supposed to be the royal Seed of Abraham, Isaac was the natural seed. But the faith Seed, the faith in the promised Word, the promised Word (don’t miss It) was that royal Seed; that was the Seed, Abraham’s faith. “We being dead in Christ, we’re Abraham’s Seed, heirs with him according to the promise.” Notice when all that was taking place, down in Sodom there was two ministers down there preaching with a great message. There was One set up here with Abraham’s group that didn’t fool with that group down there. Now watch the One that stayed with Abraham’s group, what kind of a sign He give them. He said … Now, remember, his name was Abram a few days before that; and it’s S-a-r-r-a, not S-a-r-a-h (princess). And this Man, with His back turned to the tent … The women then were different they are now. They have to get out and get their husband’s business and everything else, you know. But they didn’t do it then; they stayed back behind. So they … so them Angels setting there. The Messenger, and He said, “Abraham, where is your wife (S-a-r-a-h) Sarah?” How’d He know it? How did He know it? Abraham said, “She’s in the tent behind You.” He said, “I’m going to visit you according to the time that I promised you. I’m going to visit you.” And Sarah kind of laughed to herself. With His back to the tent, and He said, “Why did Sarah laugh, saying, ‘How can these things be?’” If she hadn’t been in Abraham, his bride at that time, God would have slayed her. So would we today with all of our unbelief, if we wasn’t in Christ. That holds us right there, see. He couldn’t hurt or couldn’t take Sarah without hurting Abraham. See? And so remember, Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of man.” We see everybody agree that the world’s in a Sodom condition. I picked up a Los Angeles paper here not long ago, and said, I think it’s “Homosexual is on the increase of twenty or thirty percent in Los Angeles, each year increasing that much.” It’s … Oh, it’s horrible! In our government and everywhere, everything’s just become a pervert. That’s right! The whole thing, the whole system, church and everything else is perverted. It’s in a perverted age. Now I want to ask you theologians something, of my brethren. Not I’m speaking against you, my dear brother; I’m here to help you, brother. I’m here to stand on what God’s Word says is right, hold your hand and bring this crowd of people out of this stuff. Right! But looky here, we never have had a messenger down in Sodom before that his name ended with a h-a-m till now. We’ve had a Spurgeon, a Wesley, a Luther, and everything else, but never an international was messenger that his name end with h-a-m, before. That’s right! See, G-r-a-h-a-m, six letters, G-r-a-h-a-m, Billy Graham; that noted evangelist, great work of God, the man is sent from God. He’s got that justification down so pat, and he shakes the nation with it, see, like that. There’s not … Look at Oral Roberts to the Pentecostal denomination. When was there ever one like that? Six letters, not seven. Abraham is A-b-r-a-h-a-m, seven. Billy Graham is G-r-a-h-a-m, six. Now look at the messengers. Look at the time we’re setting, never was a time in history. Look at the same signs that He promised would be give to each group. Look where they’re at. Same, exactly, positionally, set right in order. Nature, the world, everything, setting right exactly to the time. Now don’t miss It, while we sketch the rest of this Scripture! Quickly now, cause I’m holding you too long. Call … Looky here. And according to the prophet, he came just exactly to the Word, just exactly to the time. Now look at the age now where we’re living. Aren’t we living right in that Sodom time? Watch the messenger to Abraham’s group. Watch the numbers, letters, and the numerology of his name. You say, “There’s nothing in a name.” Don’t you never let anybody tell you that. Why did He change Abram’s name, to Abraham, Sarra to Sarah? Why did He change Simon to Peter, and all those other? See? Sure there is. Exactly! That’s the reason I say don’t, never call your child “Ricky,” or “Elvis,” or something. Elvis means “cat,” Ricky’s a “rat.” See, when you say … That’s exactly right. “Les,” or something, don’t you never call one of your child … children that. If it is, change it right quickly, people. Don’t you … You that … If you believe me to be God’s servant, don’t tack that name on that poor child. See? No, sir, give him another name besides that. My! I oughtn’t to got off on that, ’cause I’m off of my subject, but I said it and it’s all over. I … That’s how you do, you don’t know when you say it. See? Called Him, “Foreign, a fortuneteller, a devil, a Beelzebub,” and said, “He made Himself God.” Oh, my! Didn’t Isaiah the prophet said, “He would be called the Mighty God”? Isaiah 9:6, “Unto us a child is borned, a son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulders, and His Name shall be called Counselor, Prince of Peace, and Mighty God, the everlasting Father.” That’s right! Also, St. John 1:1, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” You believe that? He was just not … He was a prophet, but He was more than a prophet; He was the God-prophet. Why did He have to come? Remember, He comes in three son’s names. He came first in the name of the Son of man. He never called Himself the “Son of God.” You know that. See, He came in the Son of man, a prophet. Jehovah Himself, the Father, called Jeremiah, “son of man”; a prophet is son of man. He come … Now He come after the Day of Pentecost, He come back in the form of the Holy Ghost, supernatural Spirit. Now He’s Son of God. In the Millennium He’ll be Son of David, setting upon the throne of David. See, He come in … He’s Son of God, Son of man, Son of David. Oh, the Bible’s full of these nuggets. We can’t get them all in one night. But it’s just fitting to set this now. Tomorrow may never dawn. We may be gone before tomorrow. I may be preaching to a person that’ll be dead before in the morning. I could be gone before in the morning. Brother, sister, that’s not myth, that’s actual facts! We don’t know what time we’re going, and you’ll not have any chance after that last breath leaves your body. Make it right now, don’t wait till in the morning, may be too late. Notice now, they had done to Him just exactly what the prophets said they would do, just as they are doing to this very same day in the Laodicean Age. If you want to look at it, read Revelation 3, “Blind, naked, and don’t know it. Turning Christ … ” When He begins to reveal Hisself into the seed form again, the same one that went in the ground come back to be the Bride; just the Bride and the Groom, is the same flesh and blood, the same ministry, and the same things, doing just exactly what He done; the Spirit. And here they’re impersonating and doing everything else, and each one has got his book and running, and this. Oh, you never heard such sensations! And … [Brother Branham inhales through his nose — Ed.] “I smell a devil now.” All this, that, just as unscriptural as it can be! And the genuine thing laying right there before them, they walk away, “They don’t belong to my organization.” My, my, just, see, just blind leading the blind. Won’t they all fall in the ditch? Blinded by man’s denominational traditions, they put Him out of their church as God said they would do, in Revelation 3; as usual, as prophesied. Notice how Jesus sel- … made Hisself known to these disciples, now, and we’ll close. These two disciples, Caiaphas … Cleopas, rather, and his friend. Now we’re in the resurrection, the morning after the resurrection, the first resurrection; what a beautiful morning, Jesus is up from the dead and living among His people. What a beautiful thought! He’s here the same today as He was that day, because He’s the same yesterday, today, and for … And revealing Himself more today than He has in any other age since that day; come through the wheat and stalk and shuck (is all past now), we’re into the wheat again. See, we’re back into the grain. Known as … know … Watch how He made Hisself known to these people, now, remember, as their Messiah (just before we close) of the promised Word of the age. Notice! He appeared unto, to the … as He has said He’d do, to the prophets. Notice, “Fools, and slow of heart to believe that all the prophets has wrote of Him had to be fulfilled.” Watch Him! He refers right back to the Word of God, He never come right out and told them, “Don’t you know Me? I am the Messiah that’s resurrected.” He never said that. See, He just give them the Scripture; like John did, and the rest of them. See? He just … They have to pick that out themselves. They have to judge for theirselves. Now, don’t go to sleep, judge for yourself. “Fools, slow of heart to believe all that the prophets has said had to come to pass.” What a rebuke to them that claimed they knew Him. See? Notice how He approached the subject. He never come right out, as I said a few minutes ago, and said, “Well, don’t you know I’m your Messiah for this age? Don’t you know that I’m He?” The real servant of God never identifies himself that way; the Scripture identifies who he is. Sure, he will. But called their attention to what the prophets had said to look for in the Messiah’s age. See it? Go right back: “Fools, and slow of heart, not to believe that all the prophets said about the Messiah should come to pass.” He, as John, let the Word of the Bible identify Him, what He was to them. That should been made plain enough. If the Word had identified Him, that should be plainly Who the promise was they was looking at. They knowed he had … someone had to come on the scene at that time. Why, He said, “Now let Me show what the Word says is supposed to happen in this day.” Am not I, tonight, trying to tell you, Word by Word (even to the position, the place, the names, the numbers, everything else, and all the signs, times, and everything), that we’re right here at the end time? Surely you can see what I’m talking about. See? Look! That’s so plain it should need no more identification. He said, when He was here on earth, “Search the Scriptures, in them you think you have Eternal Life, they are what … they testify what I am, see, who I am.” Notice, He begin with Moses the prophet, a prophet, Deuteronomy 18:15. I’m watching the Scriptures here. Deuteronomy 18:15, Moses said, “The Lord your God … ” See, God spoke to him on top of the mountain. And, oh, my, the thundering; they said, “Let—let the Lord … Let Moses speak, not God, lest we perish.” He said, “They said well. I’ll … I won’t speak to them no more like this, but I’ll raise them up a prophet.” And that’s been His message all the way through. That’s what’s got to settle the whole thing at the end. It’s just got to, because the Word of the Lord has to come to the prophet. It’s the only thing It can come to. If it don’t, it breaks God’s Word and makes Him tell something wrong. See? It’ll never go to a seminary. It goes to a prophet. And the prophet is sent from God, ordained. And how you know it is, and not what the man said, … We’ve had Elijahs, and coats, and everything else, and mantels, and all kinds of nonsense, and went off into organizationism and everything else. But there will come on this earth, by God’s promise, a genuine servant of God, identified by God (by His Word being the answer of this day), that’ll set the Bride in order (a real little minority of the church) and take it up. That’s right! He’ll introduce, “Behold, there’s the One I talked about, see, that’ll come.” And all that the prophets had said about Him, and for this age, why it sure would be interesting to have heard Him say that. Wouldn’t you like to have heard Him say it? “All the prophets said about … ” Remember, He said what the prophets would say about Himself, quoting His Own Self, what He had said (and He was the Word); quoting. Now let’s listen to the Words that He quoted. Would you like to hear what He said to them? Let’s just carry their conversation now, just before we stop. Now, they were briefed on all the late happenings of the crucifixion, of the story at the grave and the tomb, and the women had seen Him, and another one said they seen Him, and so forth. He said … They—they briefed Him on that. And He goes right on with the Word about … quoting Himself through the Word: “Now look in Zechariah 12.” (He must have quoted Zechariah 11:12.) “For He was sold with thirty pieces of silver. Was not the Messiah supposed to be sold by thirty pieces of silver? “In Psalms 41:9, He was betrayed by His friends. See? “Zechariah 13:7, forsaken by His disciples. “In Psalms 35:11, accused by false witnesses. “By Isaiah 35:7, dumb before His accusers, never opened His mouth.” (All right, sir.) “Isaiah 50:6, He was scourged. “Psalms 22—22, He cried at the cross, ‘My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?’ All My bones they stare at Me. They pierced My hands and My feet.” (Look at the prophecies He could talk about!) “Isaiah 9:6, Unto us a child is born, a virgin shall conceive, so forth. “And also in Psalms 22:18, they—they—they parted His garments among them. “In Isaiah 7:14, a virgin shall conceive. “Psalms 22:7 and 8, made Him a … mocked by His enemies, His … supposed to be His friends; His enemies, the church. “In Psalms 22 again, He was … not a bone was to be broken, but they pierced His hands and His feet. “Isaiah 53:12, died with malefactors. “In Isaiah 53:9, bruised, and buried with the rich brother. “In Psalms 16:10, He was resurrected from the dead. David said so, ‘I will not suffer My Holy One to see corruption, neither will I leave His soul in hell.’ He was raised from the dead. “Malachi 3, John the Baptist was His forerunner.” And all of the types He might have went to! Even to Isaac being the type of Him upon Mount … upon the mountain where his father Abraham took him, in Genesis 22. It was now that they begin to see who had fulfilled these Scriptures that was promised of that day. It was then, after it was late, they begin to see. “Oh! Well, wait a minute! You know what?” They knew then that their crucified Friend, Jesus, was that Prophet that was promised. They knew because … See, they hadn’t been briefed on the Scriptures. “But, here, all these things that’s supposed to happen at the cross, all these things. Fools, slow of heart to understand all the prophets have said; how that the Messiah shall suffer, and enter in His glory, and raise the third day.” Still they go on. “And that’s right. I say He—He … Did not our hearts burn within us?” they said. No wonder their hearts burned! The prophecies that He was giving that was fulfilled. Then they begin to understand that their Friend, the Man that they eat with, talked with, associated with, fished with, laid in the woods, that that fulfilled every Word of the promised hour! There it was. They had walked six miles, it seemed a very short time, I suppose, and they had heard a six-hour sermon on vindicated prophecy (a little longer than what we’ve had tonight, see). It was now getting kind of late in the evening time, the evening Lights had come. It’s the same time now, church! The evening Lights has come! Hebrews 13:8, “He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever.” Oh, events made clear by prophecy, same today. The evening Light promised by the prophet of God, in Zechariah 14:7, may again open the true believer’s eyes to the events that’s taking place today, that’s proved by the prophecies that we’re at the end time. Jesus is coming. The very … It’s … He said, “There will be a day that it won’t be called night or day.” He said, “But in the evening it shall be Light.” Now, we know, geographically, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Now, the prophet said, “There’ll be a long stretch of time that’ll be dismal, kind of a … couldn’t be called day or night; it’s kind of a dark, gloomy day.” Now, where did the Son rise? What … That was S-o-n we’re talking about now. That the natural s-o-n rises in the east and sets in the west. The very same God, very same … Sun, rather. And the S-o-n of God rose first in the east, to the eastern people. And now after He left, what did they do? Three hundred years later, they started their first organization, the Roman Catholic church. Through the Dark Age they went, and out they come. What’d they do? The same thing. It’s been a day of … It hasn’t been called day or night. They had enough orders, and they believed that He was the Son of God, and walked in the light what they had, they made their churches, they built hospitals and schools and so forth, and seminaries, sent their children to school. But the prophet said, “It shall be Light again about the evening time. The Son will peep out again, it shall be Light.” What? The same Son (S-o-n) that was revealed in flesh at the morning time, back there, will be revealed again in the evening time. Now compare Saint Luke 17:30, “And in that day, as it was in the days of Sodom, the setting of the world, in the time that the Son of man is being revealed.” It shall be Light about the evening time, The way to Glory you will surely find. Oh, my! People, where are we at? Nations are breaking, Israel’s awak’ning, The signs that the prophets foretold; The Gentile days numbered, with harrows encumbered; (Watch her slide into the sea!) Return, O dispersed, to your own. The day of redemption is near, Man’s hearts are failing for fear; Be filled with the Spirit, have your lamps trimmed and clear, Look up! your redemption is near. (You better.) Brother, sister, it’s a scary time. Watch the things that’s prophesied, watch the things happen. Watch all the prophecy being fulfilled, then we see what all this is about. It’s not a bunch … a streak of fanaticism. It’s God confirming His Words exactly, exactly. The Rock is smitten, friends, flee to It as quick as you can. Prophecy is vindicating the day that we are living in. Let us bow our heads. [A brother speaks in another tongue. A sister gives an interpretation. A brother on the platform says, “Can we hold steady for just a moment? God has spoken to us through Brother Branham, and the anointing is on Brother Branham, and he’s not through. And … ” Blank spot on tape — Ed.] Dear God! Are you realizing the day that we live in, friends? Would you dare dispute God? Would you say that “He’s not right,” when He’s proved It? He’s His Own interpreter. Do you want to serve Him? Now with your heads bowed, and your hearts bowed, brother, sister. This may be our last meeting time. We may never … If I would be back a year from today, if I live, there’d be many that’s here now won’t be here then. And I’ll have to meet you at the Judgment Bar and answer for everything that I said tonight. Before God, while you’re in your right mind, would you now do this much to God? If you know that you’re … Just look at yourself in the looking glass of God (the Bible), no matter who you are, and say, “I know I’m way short from being a daughter of God, look the way I do. I’m way short from being a son of God, look the way I do. But, God, I don’t want to be here, I—I want to strive to that place.” I want you to raise your hand to God, just ever who you are, wherever you are across the building, “Yes, I want to be a son of God. I want to be a daughter of God. I want to fulfill everything that my Lord has commanded.” Now you … God bless you. I guess ninety percent of the audience. Now looky here, my friend. What if you would have lived in the days when you heard John preach? What if you would have lived in the days when Jesus was here? Whose side would you have took? If you’d lived in Jesus’ … Remember, if He … If you’d lived back there, it would be just like it is now. The same Jesus is making Himself known by His Word, see, and It’s very unpopular. But let me tell you, I’m not trying to tell people to leave church or … My, I want you to go to church, “Don’t forsake to assemble yourself together.” But what I’m trying to tell you to do is press into the Kingdom of God. Get these things, the world, church … Pentecostals, you people are getting too worldly. You’re getting too much after the world. It’s just easy, you keep watching televisions and all these things, and the way they’re doing, and all this, and the first thing you know … The seminaries, the schools are beginning to compromise here and there, and this, that, and the other, and the first thing you know … It’s got to come that way. The Pentecostal church, it’s been my greatest support, I can’t say nothing against it. But that’s what I cry out, “My brethren, get out!” Call … You don’t have the meetings that you used to have. The people are not like they used to be. But Jesus Christ is the same, let’s move into Him. Now, you with your hands up, remember, there was a Rock smitten in the wilderness, and that fountain is still open tonight. Their Rock has been smitten, Christ, He is that smitten Rock. And tonight, so far as I know, the church may be … The time of calling may be already past, I don’t know, I can’t say that. Remember, the people went right on having the meetings, just the same, after the crucifixion of Jesus. And the … and all the people, they—they’ll come, they … Watch! They—they’ll go right on preaching, and saying they’re “getting saved” and everything, just as if … “The world continues on as it was,” they say. But it’ll be too late then. While you got a chance, my brother; while you got a chance, my sister; come into the Kingdom of God. You don’t have to come in under anything else but just plain faith to believe His Word. He is that Word! “Lord Jesus, I know I’m looking at myself now in the mirror of God’s Word; oh, how short I am. But, dear God, here tonight, on this Monday night, here in San Bernardino, California, in this auditorium here, this is—this is all I have, Lord, but I’ll give it to You. Will You take me as I am, Lord? Will You let me flee to the cross right quick? I even see the messengers. I see the time, I see the calling out of Sodom. I see the signs. I see the Abraham’s group receiving the Light. I see the manifestation, Jesus being manifested again right among us like it was. I see all the things that You promised. I see the impersonators; I see You said that, ‘As it was in the days of Moses,’ how this Jambres and Jannes would come back to impersonate, and still remain right in that same dump that they were in.” See, they couldn’t follow Moses through that Word and take those children out of there into the wilderness, because they was associated in Egypt. They couldn’t do it, though they done the same works he did. But their folly was made manifest. And the Bible says, that’s THUS SAITH THE LORD, “It will take place again in the last days.” And you see it with your own eyes, if you’re spiritual. I’m … I can’t explain It. It’s not necessary for me to explain It. “My sheep hear My Voice.” Let’s go to Him now, while we have a chance. Will you? If you have need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, if you have need of a rededication, a new life; your pastor won’t despise you, he’ll love you for it. Just give yourself completely to God tonight, while we’re here. Let … Yes, I know it’s been hard, cutting, strange, I don’t do that to be mean, I do that to be honest. I do that because I love you, I love God, and I do it to try to help you. And truly, friend, I—I—I believe … And with all my heart, with all my faith, I believe that my Message comes from God. It’s—It’s been proving that to you, through the years. Now listen, tonight surrender everything you got, everything that you have need of. I believe, with a true, surrendered heart, if you will just stand upon your feet, and raise up your hands to God, and say, “Dear God, here I am. Take me, Lord. No more will I try to use my own mind and my own interpretation. Your Word says I must be ‘holy, I must be borned again, I must be filled with the Spirit, and then the Spirit will lead me into all the Truth.’ Dear God, here I am, lead me.” Would you do that much? If you do that much, raise your hand, say, “I’m willing to do that, I’m willing to.” Then let’s all stand up on our feet. Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy Blood was shed for me, And that Thou bids me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, (God’s only Door) … come! I … Now get all of your work, everything else, your tiredness, everything … What if you were dying now? Just as I am, Thou will receive, Will welcome, pardon, cleanse, receive; Because I … Will you put your hand up, on this verse now? I promise, I will believe, O Lamb of God, I come! I come! Now while the organist continue—continues to play, let’s each one of us … Young teen-agers, do you want to get like this out here on the street, this bunch of hoodlums? Sister, do you want to wear short hair, when it’s your Nazarite honor to God to have long hair? “It’s a shame for her to cut her hair.” Would you wear these little ol’ skirts and things that they wear today, this—this immoral dress, with your body showing through it, out there on the street? Did you know every man that looks upon you commits adultery with you in his heart? And you present yourself like that. Do you know, women, you that wear makeup, there’s only one woman in the Bible that ever wore makeup? And God fed her to the dogs. A Jezebel, a name that’s been hated since her day, because of her acts of that. You know it was Elijah the prophet who cursed that and called her out in that manner? Do you know it was Herodias that John the Baptist got after? Do you … You don’t want to be that Hollywood thing of the world. “If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not in you.” Brother, minister friend, nothing … Please understand me, I am your brother. Do you want to associate yourself, and you church members of some church (Methodist, Baptist, or whatever you been), do you want to hold on in that denomination because your mother and your grandmother held on that? She come out of something to come into that, that was the Light of that day; that, like in the times of Noah. This is another day. You say, “Well, I had the … ” This is not the day of Pentecost. The Pentecostal age is past. Pentecost is gone, this is harvest time. See? And the harvest time, the grain; the water’s done been poured out, the grain’s getting ripe. Come into the grain, my dear brother. Hear me, believe me, if you believe me to be a servant of God, let each one, in our own way, bow our head in humility and offer the prayer that we—that we know that we should offer, “God, take me as I am.” And brother, sister, I lay myself on the altar tonight, too: God, mold me and make me different. Do something, God, make me in Your fashion. You think it’s easy to stand here and cut the people to pieces like that? It’s a hard thing to do. But woe unto me if I don’t do it. Dear God, as this audience bows their head and heart, in this solemn moments here of closing of this Bible lecture; when we see the vindication of the Holy Spirit that shook this nation back and forth, and back and forth, great revivals and indications, knowing that something has to follow that. And then see those seven Angels come down there on top of that mountain yonder in Arizona, when even the magazines across the nation’s packed It. To see Jesus Himself there in the skies, looking down, and saying that, “In the Revelation 10:7, in the seventh angel’s Message, these seals would be opened, the mysteries of God would be made known.” That the reformers didn’t live long enough to—to bring it out. And here, these seven seals that sealed the whole thing is to be opened in this day. To see all these great signs and wonders that’s been done, vindicated, foretold before it happened, and not one time have You ever failed us, but brought it to pass just as it was said. Dear God, we realize that Jesus Christ is in our midst. We know that He is here. He’s here tonight, the invisible God is here with us, and can confirm every promise that He made in His Word. How You have stood and proved to them, with backs turned, in the original beginning before the impersonators even entered the ring, Lord, or entered into the—the—the race, as it was. You showed and proved, prophesied and told exactly the way it would happen, and we see it’s happened that way. And Father, God, we know it cannot be man, it has to be God. So we know it’s You here tonight. Forgive us of our sins. Dear God, You’ve healed our sickness, now for—forgive our sins, Lord, of not being the kind of Christian that we should be, not … Professing to be a full-Gospel man or woman, and here we find ourselves slumping off like a denominational chicken. Help us, dear God, take us and shake us with Your Holy Spirit. And if there be anything in us that’s not like You, take it out of us, Lord. And plant our feet on God’s Holy Word, and let the Holy Ghost burn down into our heart and take all the dross of unbelief and the drowsiness of this day; oh, arise and shake ourself. Grant it, God. Cleanse us! Mold us! Make us! God, grant it. If there’s any in here tonight, Lord, that’s holding in their heart that grain, that gene of God that’s ordained to Life from the foundation of the world; I know, Lord, that they’re bound to hear at this hour. So, I pray, God, that You’ll fill their soul and illuminate them with a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost, and send them on their road, rejoicing and happy. Lord God, they … I give them to You. I don’t know who they are, You do. I’m only responsible for preaching Your Word, Lord, as You reveal It. You’re responsible for the rest of it: where the Seed falls. I just throw It. Lord God, I pray that It fell in good, rich soil tonight. That many will see It, Lord, and rise to shining Christians in this last days, that the great thing that we’re looking forward to come, will come quickly. Grant it, Lord. And You’ll take Your Church, Your Bride, and take Her home. We see It all setting in order. Come, Lord Jesus. We commit it all to You, in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the results. Amen. I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On Calvary’s … Do you love Him? Well, then you have to love one another. Shake one another’s hand when you sing it again: I love Him, I love Him Because He first loved me And purchased my salvation On … Now let’s give Him praise. How many knows this song: I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain. Let’s sing it now: I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain. Don’t you feel all scoured out? Raise your hands and say, “Oh, that makes me feel good.” Brother, I love those old-time songs. Don’t you? They go down to the heart. I will praise Him, I will praise Him, Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory all ye people, For His Blood has washed away each stain. Let’s just raise our hands now and praise God, every one of us, in our own way: Lord Jesus, we thank You. We praise You, Lord. We give You praise for a called-out people, out of Babylon. We thank You for the Blood of Your Son, Jesus Christ. We thank You because He makes us clean this minute. We for- … We ask forgiveness of our wrongs, our stupidity, Lord, our stumbling in the dark. O God, may we rise and shine, and walk in the evening Light, and be the fruit of the Tree that’s coming forth by the evening Lights. Grant it, dear God. We commit ourselves to You, in Jesus Christ’s Name. Now with your heads bowed, I give you the pastors backing the service. 
Thank you, Brother Williams. Greetings, Brother Salano and his wife, and all the delegates here at this banquet tonight. It’s certainly a great privilege to be here. I’ve looked forward for this hour ever since we have started this way. And I want to thank that lady, I can’t think of her name, Billy just told me, that had give me a box of Christmas candy, and just brought it out to the car a few moments ago. The sister, I can’t think of her name, she’s from here in California. That was my first Christmas present. So I thank you for it. Now, tonight it’s … Now in Tucson it’s ten minutes after nine, but I think it’s just ten minutes after eight here. So we … I have kind of a feeling amongst the people, I’m kind of long-winded in preaching, so I hope … [Congregation applauds] Thank you. Such a … some nice persons in here. I thank you. But I’m just a little bit preached out, almost, tonight, I’ve been going so long from Shreveport and across the country (coming this way) night after night, and you get just a little shook up, you know, and cold, and your throat gets hoarse. I started out at Shreveport. I lost my hair when I was … few years ago. And I had a little piece I put on when I’m preaching in the north country, to keep from taking a cold. I went to Shreveport and forgot it, and I really got a cold. Them wind coming across like that, you really just don’t know. It was taken out accidentally, and the skin’s still soft, and with just a little perspiration and I’ve really got it in the throat; had to close many meetings. So I’m just a teeny bit hoarse tonight. We want to say we’ve had a wonderful time coming across here, though, in the meetings. Last night we had a wonderful time up in … with the brethren, up, the other chapter. And so had a great crowd out and wonderful attendance, the people so reverent and nice. So it makes me feel real good to be a part of the Full Gospel Business Men. It’s been … I have a Message, I feel, from God. It’s a little odd to some people. And I can’t help being no more … I just got to be what I am. And we … I don’t mean to be different, it’s just that I’m living at a changing time. We’re … As long as you’re building the wall one straight way, it’s all fine, the bricklayers can go right down the row. But when you have to turn the corner, that’s where the time … And we’re not building a wall; we’re building a house, you see, so these turns has to come. They come in the age of Martin Luther, John Wesley, and the Pentecostal age; it’s here again. So we … it’s hard to turn the corners. But I’m so thankful for … to God, even though how rough it’s been, the people has responded one hundred percent. So we’re very grateful, thank each one of you. And now before we open the Book, let’s speak to the Author, if you will, just a moment, while we bow our heads: Dear God, we are grateful to You tonight for the privilege of knowing Jesus Christ (our Saviour) Your Son, in the free pardoning of our sins, and to know that His Blood is sufficient that’s covered all of our sins and our iniquities. They’re so blotted out and put in the sea of God’s forgetfulness and His Bride will stand at the Wedding Supper, pure, unadulterated, to marry the Son of God. How we thank Thee for this all-sufficiency and the faith to know that we do not trust in our own merits but in His merit alone, for what He did for us. We’re so grateful. Thank You for the success that these brethren had overseas and the countries over there where they’re hungering and thirsting for God. I pray, Lord, that if they go back again, that those children that they brought into the Kingdom will be great-grandmothers and grandfathers of the children that they bring in also. Grant it, Father. Bless us together, tonight, and may the Holy Spirit give to us the things that we have need of. Close our mouths to the things that we should not say, and open our hearts to receive what You would tell us. Grant it, Father. In Jesus’ Name we pray. Amen. Now let’s turn in the Bible to a little text that I would like to speak on for a while tonight, and it’s found over in Saint Mark, the 10th chapter. And I had … A few years ago when I would speak, I wouldn’t even have to write a note, I could remember it. And I didn’t have to take a pair of glasses to read it out of the Bible. But since I’ve passed twenty-five now, twice, and so kind of little hard for me to do like I used to do. And it’s like a worn-out car, but I’m still running. Uh-huh, I want to keep on chugging along till it’s … I go to the scrap heap to be molded over again. That’s the promise. Saint Luke, the 10th chapter, and begin at the … I believe I said the 21st verse, if I can find it here somewhere. I’m mistaken, it’s Saint Mark. I’m sorry. Saint Mark, the 10th chapter, and the twenty- … beginning with the 21st verse, I want to read. Let’s get the 17th verse, rather: And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeling down to him, and asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, and that is, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth. Then said … Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, and sell whatsoever thou hast, and, give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasures in heaven: and come, and take up thy cross, and follow me. And he was sad at that saying, and he went away grieved: for he had great possessions. And may the Lord bless the reading of His Word. Now, we’re going to speak tonight on a subject. I want my text to be “Follow Me,” and my subject: Leadership. Now it’s strange, but I thought maybe, today in praying … And I’ve been so long, and each night right down the line on the Message that I have, that the Lord has given to me to speak on. I thought tonight, over in this new chapter, I would approach it from a different standpoint. And many times we have talked on this, called it, “The Rich Young Ruler.” And many of the ministers here, my brethren, no doubt have approached it in many different ways. And I want to try to approach it in a different way tonight than I ever have, this of Leadership. This, remember this, that each one of us, young and old, your first step that you ever made in your life, someone had to lead you. That’s right. And your last step you ever make, someone will be leading you. Someone has to lead. God has likened us unto sheep. And if anyone knows about raising sheep and the nature of sheep, why, you know that a sheep cannot find his way around. He has to be led. Even in the slaughter pens, we find that they bring the sheep there and he’s led up into the slaughter by a goat. A goat leads him up, then when he gets up to the end of the chute he jumps out, and the sheep goes right on into the slaughter. So they … We find that a sheep cannot find his way around. I remember an experience I had with one, one time. I was state game warden in Indiana, and I had been out in the field; and I heard something, the most pitiful cry. And it was a little lamb, had lost his mama. And he couldn’t find his way to her, and the mother couldn’t find her way to the little lamb. I picked the little fellow up, and how quiet he laid against me. I went along there, my hands holding the little fellow. And crying, and I heard him. How he just snugg’ed his little head down against me and it seemed like he knew that I was going to help him. I thought, “O Rock of Ages, cleft for me, pick me up in the arms of the Lord Jesus, just be content as I know I’m going to go Home to be with my loved ones.” I thought, “At the end of my life’s journey, just bring me in Your arms, Lord, like that. That I know I’ll be carried across the river then, there on the other side where there’ll be no sorrows and sicknesses, and things, and I’ll be with the loved ones that I’ve loved.” And if you’ll study nature, there’s a great thing in nature. Everything that I look at, and God has made, He’s the Author of nature. Nature runs in continuity. All nature runs about the same. You notice, everything … As I have said, I believe last evening, that “Nature testifies of God.” If you never had a Bible, you could still watch nature and know that this Bible is the Truth. I had the privilege of being around and around the world. And I’ve read the different phases, and I’ve seen different religions; the Mohammedans, and I’ve read the Koran, and seen the Sikhs, the Jains, and Mohammedans, and the Buddhists, and whatmore. But yet, each one of them, they have a philosophy and a book of creed and a book of laws, and so forth. But our Bible is the Truth, and our God is the only One that is right; ’cause each one of them has to point to a grave somewhere where their founder is still laying, but Christianity points to an open tomb and can live in the Presence of the One that was put in there. He is alive! It’s not a God that was, It’s a God that is. Not a “I was” or “I will be,” but “I AM.” And all nature runs in continuity, as I have said, talking on our Church Ages (which we have the books now that’s coming out). The … Why did I … about my writing of the Church Ages. And how that we see the Church, how It’s matured, come up just exactly like all nature does. And we was talking the other day about how the sun rises in the morning, it’s a little baby, real weak, not much strength to it at all. And as the day goes on, it gets stronger, stronger. About eight o’clock it enters school, like a young boy or young girl. And then about eleven o’clock it’s out of school, and it’s ready for its service. And then across till about three o’clock it changes, in the middle life into old age. And then dies in the afternoon. Is that the end of the sun? No. It comes back the next morning, to testify that there is a life, a death, a burial, a resurrection. See? See? We watch the trees, how they move and what they do. I was sometime ago down in Kentucky, I like to squirrel hunt, and I went down in the fall of the year there to squirrel hunt with a friend of mine. And it’s … got very dry. And anyone ever hunted gray squirrel, know that how hard it is to slip up on them. When, the leaves, just crack one, and, oh, Houdini is an amateur escape artist to those fellows, how they can get away! And then trying to shoot eye shots at fifty yards, it takes some good hunting to get your limit in a day. So, Mr. Wood, a friend of mine, a converted Jehovah Witness, was with me. And we … He said, “I know a farm over here where there’s a man that’s got a lot of … ” We call them there, “hollers.” How many know what a holler is? Well, what part of Kentucky you from, anyhow? See? And that’s where I am from. Like here in one of the chapters, not long ago; I have to tell this to Brother Williams and them, the brethren. They said, “We will now stand and sing the national anthem.” And I said, “For my old Kentucky home.” So nobody joined in with me, so … That was the only anthem I knew. And so we was now … All right, sir. [Brother Branham is handed a note]: “Please have prayer, for a lady in here now is bleeding at the nose.” Let us pray: Dear God, I ask You, Lord, Thou art the great Healer and I ask that Your grace and mercy will touch this dear woman just now and stop that blood. As a believing people who assembled together, the lady has come here to enjoy the Word of the Lord and the fellowship of the people, and I ask You, Lord, just now, to rebuke the enemy and stop the blood. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Amen. (And we believe it, we believe it.) On with the little story just to kind of get a feeling before we get right down in the few notes I’ve got written here, and some Scripture. Now he said, “Well, this old man, we’ll go over and see him. He’s got a lot of hollers in his place,” he said, “but he’s an infidel.” He said, “If … He just about curse us out if we went over there.” I said, “But we’re not getting no squirrels here. We been camping two weeks.” And we was dirty, and beard all out on face. And he said, “Well?” I said, “Let’s go over.” So we went a few miles down, about twenty miles. I’d been in the country down there once before, for three nights, at a Methodist campground where there had been some great things the Lord had did, and great healing service amongst the Methodist people. And then we went way back over some hills and hollers and ridges. And you just have to know Kentucky to know it, what kind of a place you had to get into. And while we went back there we come to a house, and there sat an old man, two old men, setting out there with the old hats slouched down over their face, and he said, “There he is,” he said, “he’s a tough one.” Said, “He hates that word of a ‘preacher,’” he said. So I said, “Well, I just better set in the car, or we won’t get to hunt at all.” I said, “You go in and ask him if we can hunt.” So he got out and started walking in, he spoke to them. And in Kentucky, always, you know, it’s “come in,” and so forth. And so he went up there and he said, “I just wondered if we could hunt a while on your place.” The old man setting there, about seventy-five years old, tobacco running down his mouth, he said … spit, and he said, “What’s your name?” He said, “My name is Wood.” He said, “Are you any relation to old man Jim that used to live … ” He said, “Yeah, I’m Jim’s boy.” Said, “I’m Banks. Yeah.” “Well,” he said, “old man Jim was an honest man.” Said, “Certainly, help yourself.” He said, “Are you by yourself?” He said, “No, my pastor is out there.” He said, “What?” He said, “My pastor is out in the car,” said, “he’s hunting with me.” He said, “Wood, you don’t mean you’ve got so low-down till you have to tote a preacher with you wherever you go?” So he’s a rough, old character, so I thought I’d better get out of the car, you know. So I got out and walked around, and he said, “Well, and you’re a preacher, huh?” I said, “Yes, sir.” He looked me up and down; squirrel blood, and dirt. He said … I said, “Don’t look much like it. ” He said, “Well, I kind of like that.” He said, “You know, I want to tell you something.” He said, “I’m supposed to be an infidel!” I said, “Yes, sir, I understood that.” I said, “I don’t think it’s much to brag about, though. Do you?” And he said, “Well,” he said, “I don’t know.” He said, “I’m going to tell you what I think of you guys.” I said, “All right.” He said, “You’re barking up the wrong tree.” And how many knows what that means? See? It means it’s a lying dog, you see; the coon’s not up there at all, see. He said, “You’re barking up the wrong tree.” I said, “That’s to opinion.” And he said, “Well,” he said, “look, you see that old chimney standing up there?” “Yes.” “I was borned up there, seventy-five years ago.” And said, “I’ve lived right here in these hills, all around, through all these years.” And said, “I’ve looked towards the skies, I’ve looked here and there, and, surely, in all these seventy-five years, I would have seen something that looked like God. Didn’t you think so?” I said, “Well, it depends on what you’re looking at, see, or what you’re looking for.” And he said, “Well,” he said, “I certainly don’t believe there is such a creature. And I believe you fellows just simply get out and swindle the people out of their money and everything. And that’s the way it goes.” I said, “Well, you’re an American citizen, you have a right to your own thinking.” He said, “There’s one guy, one time, that I heard of,” he said, “that I would sure … If he … If I would ever get to talk with that fellow,” said “I’d like to ask him a few questions.” I said, “Yes, sir.” He said, “It was a preacher, you might know him.” Said, “He had a meeting up here in Campbellsville, not long ago, in a church yard up there, a campground.” And he said, “I forget his name.” Said, “He’s from Indiana.” And I said, “Oh? Yes, sir.” And Brother Wood started to say, “Well, I … ” (“Don’t say that.”) And so he said … I said, “What about him?” He said, “Well,” he said, “old lady … ” (somebody) “up there on the hill … ” Said, “You know, she was dying with cancer.” And said, “Wife and I would go up there of a morning to change her bed.” Said, “They couldn’t even raise her up high enough to put her on the bedpan,” said, “just had to pull a draw sheet.” And said, “She was dying. She had been to Louisville, and said the doctors had give her up and said she was ‘going to die.’ “And her sister went up to that meeting, and said, ‘That preacher was standing up there on the platform, looked back over the audience and called this woman by name, and told her, “When she left, she took a handkerchief and put it in her purse.” And called this woman’s name down here, twenty miles below here, and said how she was suffering with cancer, what her name was, and all she’d been through; said, “Take that handkerchief and go lay it on the woman,” and said that “the woman will be healed of her cancer.”’” And said, “They come down here that night.” Said, “Honest, I heard the awfulest screaming up there. I thought they had the Salvation Army turned loose on top of the hill up there. Said, ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I guess old sister is dead.’ Said, ‘We’ll … Tomorrow we’ll go and get the wagon, and how we take her out to get to the main road,’ and said, ‘so they could take her to the undertaker.’ And said that the … We waited. No need of going up that time of night.” Said, “It’s about a mile up on the hill here.” Said, “We went up there the next morning, and you know what happened?” I said, “No, sir.” He said, “She was setting there eating fried apple pies, and drinking coffee, with her husband.” I said, “You mean that?” He said, “Yes, sir.” “Oh!” I said. “Now, mister, you really don’t mean that.” He said, “What bothers me is what … how did that man, and never in this country, and knew that.” See? And I said, “Oh, you don’t believe that.” He said, “It’s the truth.” I said, “You believe that?” See? He said, “Well, go right up there on the hill, I can prove it to you.” He’s preaching back to me now, you see. So I said, “Um-um.” I picked up an apple, and I said, “Can I have one of these apples?” And I rubbed it on my clothes. He said, “Well, the yellow jackets are eating them up, I guess you can have one.” And then … And now I said, “Well, … ” I bite … bit into it, and I said, “That’s a nice apple.” He said, “Oh, yes.” Said, “You know what? I planted that tree there, oh, forty years ago, or something like that.” I said, “Oh, is that right?” “Yes, sir.” And I said, “Well, and every year … ” I said, “I notice we haven’t had no frost yet, it’s early August.” And I said, “Them leaves are falling off the trees.” “Yes, sir. That’s right, it’s coming on fall. Believe we’ll have a early one this time.” I said, “Yes, sir.” Changed the subject, see. And he said … I said, “Well, you know, it’s strange,” I said, “how that sap goes out of that tree.” I said, “And them leaves falls off, and yet there’s no … they haven’t had no frost to kill the leaf.” And he said, “Well,” he said, “what’s that got to do with what we’re talking about?” And I said, “Well, I just wonder.” (You know, mama always said, “Give a cow enough rope and it’ll hang itself, you know.” So I just give him plenty of rope.) So he went on out, and he said, “Well, yes, what’s that got to do with it?” I said, “You know, God brings them apples up, and you enjoy those apples and leaves, and you set in the shade and so forth. It goes down in the fall of the year and,” I said, “comes back up again with the apples and with the leaves again.” And he said, “Oh, that’s just nature. See, that’s just nature.” I said, “Well, of course, that’s nature.” I said, “That’s nature, but Somebody has to control nature.” See, I … he said … “You tell me now what does that?” And he said, “Well, it’s just naturally nature.” I said, “Who is it that says to that little leaf now, and the … ?” I said, “Now, the reason that leaf falls off, it’s because the sap goes down into the root. And what if that sap stayed up in the tree through the wintertime? What would happen?” Said, “It would kill the tree.” “Well,” I said, “now, what intelligence that runs that sap down into the roots, says, ‘Get out of here now, it’s coming fall of the year, get down into the roots and hide’? And stay down into the roots like a grave; and then next spring comes back up again, brings up more apples, and brings up more leaves and things.” He said, “That’s just nature, it’ll do it.” Said, “The weather! The changing, you know, coming on fall.” I said, “Set a bucket of water on the post out there, and see if nature runs it down the bottom of the post and brings it back up again. See?” See? “Well,” he said, “you might have something.” I said, “Think of it while we go hunting.” And he said, “Well,” and he said, “hunt where you want to.” And I said, “When I come back, if you’ll tell me what intelligence runs that sap out of that tree down into the roots, to stay all winter and come back the next winter, I’ll tell you that’s the same Intelligence that told me about that woman up there.” Said, “Told you?” I said, “Yes, sir.” He said, “You’re not that preacher!” I said, “Would you know his name?” Said, “Yes.” I said, “Branham?” He said, “That’s him.” I said, “That’s right.” See? And you know what? I led the old man to Christ, right there on his own testimony. And a year later I was down there and pulled a car (Indiana license on it) in the yard. They had moved away, he had died. And so when I come back, there stood his wife to really rake me over; I thought I had permission to hunt. And she come out there, she said, “Can’t you read?” I said, “Yes, ma’am.” She said, “Did you see those signs saying ‘No Hunting!’?” I said, “Yes, ma’am, but,” I said, “I have permission.” “You do not have permission!” she said. And said, “We got this place posted for many years.” I said, “Well, sister, I was wrong then, I’m sorry.” And said, “Sorry nothing! Them Indiana license on there, and set up here, you’re the boldest people!” I said, “Could I just explain it?” I said … She, “Who give you permission?” I said, “I don’t know just … ” I said, “It was an elderly man setting out there on the porch, when I was down here last year, and we was talking about God.” See? And she looked, she said, “Are you Brother Branham?” And I said, “Yes, ma’am.” She said, “Forgive me. I didn’t know who you were.” She said, “I want to tell you his testimony. His last dying hours, he raised up his hands and praised God.” Said, “He died in Christian faith, and was carried away to God.” See? “If they hold their peace, the rocks will immediately cry out.” There’s something in nature. Watch the birds, watch the animals, watch everything, and you watch nature. Watch the little dove how he flies. What a different bird he is, see. He doesn’t have any gall, he can’t eat like the crow can. See? He has no gall in him. He doesn’t have to take a bath in the water, because he’s got something on the inside of him; it cleans him from the inside out, you see. That’s the way the Christian is. That’s the way God represented Himself, in a dove. See, because … and the … Jesus was represented as a Lamb. Always in nature you’ll find God. And God likened us unto sheep that has to be led. Did you ever notice there, I preached a sermon on it sometime ago? That the Dove coming down on the Lamb, to lead the Lamb, and It led Him to the slaughter. The Dove! Now, if that Lamb … That Dove could not have descended upon any other type of animal, because they both had to be of the same nature. See? If the Dove would’ve lit upon a wolf, and he would have snorted or growled, the Dove would have took Its flight. Well, that’s the same way now. And our ill ways, the Holy Spirit just takes His flight and goes away. It’s got to have the same nature. The bird of the Heavens, the dove; the meekest animal on earth, the lamb; they can agree together. And when the Holy Spirit comes upon us and makes us new creatures, then He can lead us. But we try to live the same old life, it won’t work! It just won’t work. Now, the first step you probably ever taken in your life, speaking of leadership, is probably the hands of some kind old mother. Them hands may be still tonight, out here in some cemetery somewhere, but that was the hand that held you to make your first step. Then after mother taught you how to walk, and you’d make a few steps then fall down, and get up, and you thought you were doing great things, then she turned you over to the school teacher. And then she begin to lead you to an education; of how and what you must do, and how you must learn, and so forth like that. Then after the school teacher got through with you, then you returned back, your father got a hold of you. Then when your father got a hold of you, he taught you perhaps your business; how to be a successful businessman, how to do things right. Your mother taught you how to be a housewife, how to cook, and so forth like that. Then after they got through with you, then your minister or priest got a hold of you. But now who leads you? That’s the question now. Now, we’re all led by something tonight. We have to be. We’re led. Notice! Now let’s look at this young fellow’s … what had influenced him. Let’s look at the … this young businessman we would call him, ’cause he was a businessman. He was a great successful man. Let’s look at his leaders. Perhaps, first, his mother had taught him as a little boy the things that he should do. His father had made him such a fine success, and maybe left him an inheritance, because he was a ruler himself; perhaps his father was gone, so he was a businessman. He was a … Let’s call him, today, like a Christian businessman; or, he was a religious businessman, I think would be the best quotation. This man was religious, he was by no means an infidel. And he had been taught by his mother how to do right, how to walk, how to dress himself. He had been taught by his father, a great business, and how to be a successful man; and his business was successful. And father and mother had been raised up in the church, and had pointed him to the priest. And the priest had made him a real religious man. Therefore he was a fine cultured man, he was a fine boy with good character. If Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him, there was something about the boy was real. Right. For the Bible said here, we find out in Mark, “And Jesus beholding him, loved him.” Yeah, “Jesus beholding him, loved him.” So therefore there must be something real outstanding about this young fellow. He was a … had a good character, and a good character rating. He was a man that was raised right; intelligent, smart, intellectual, successful in business, and a religious man. He had a lot of good characteristics that was outstanding, so much that it attracted the attention of Jesus Christ the Saviour. But when he was confronted, being successful in all these other things … Nothing had went wrong; he was perfectly cut out right, measured up right, intelligent, right education, his success, he was smart, a fine businessman, probably belonged to a businessman’s group somewhere there in Palestine. He might have belonged to a businessman’s fellowship like we have here tonight, no doubt he did, because businessman has always had fellowships with another, one with the other. Cause just like “birds of a feather,” they have things to talk about. And if this … The religious men, they don’t want to talk about the man that runs the barroom and the … all of them together, ’cause they have nothing in common. We’ve got to have things in common. So Christians has things in common with Christians; sinners has things in common with sinners; and societies, and whatever they are, they have things in common. And this young boy probably belonged to a businessman’s fellowship. And he was religious as he could be, because Jesus, in question him here, he said, “I have kept these commandments, observed them all from my youth.” That’s right. See, he had been brought up right, taught right, and everything. But when he was confronted with the thought of Eternal Life … Now I want you to notice, with all this character that he had, he yet knew he did not possess Eternal Life. Now, all of our societies, our church, our membership and the things that we hold so dear, our American societies, and everything, is very fine, there’s nothing to be said against that. And our Christian Business Men’s society here, is a great thing, it’s been a open door for me to … on my interdenominational thoughts that “we are Christians.” There is no one (no one denomination) can claim us, a real Christian, because you belong to God. Denominations are man-made, and Christianity is Heaven-sent. But in all these things that we have, as good as they are, as fine as we come together, and as nice of meetings as we have, and social understanding that we have, yet we’re each one confronted with Eternal Life. And no matter how successful we’ve been in business, how successful we been, and what a great church member we are, and how we work, how we try to do things right, still, if it’s not done in the right way, it is a worship of God in vain. Jesus classed that the same way, as I stop here for a moment. He said, “In vain do you worship Me, teaching for doctrine the commandments of man.” Now think! A sincere, honest worship (with the sincerity of your heart) to God, and still be in vain! It began that way with Cain, at the garden of Eden. Sincere worship, but was rejected! Very religious, still rejected! In Shreveport last week, week before last, at a Business Men’s meeting, a breakfast there where several hundreds of people had gathered, I took two and a half hours to speak on: Doing God A Service Without Being God’s Will. Now, that sounds strange, but we’ve got to channel ourselves into God’s provided channel and God’s way of doing it. No matter how much we think it’s right, it’s got to be according to the Word of the Lord or it’s in vain. Cain worshipped, but it wasn’t according to the Word of the Lord. The Pharisees worshipped, but not according to the Word of the Lord. And in this particular message to the Business Men, I taught this. David, he wanted to do the Lord a service, and he was right in what he said. He said, “Is it right for the ark of the Lord to be down there? Let’s bring it up here.” In the days of the king, the other king that he succeeded. He said, “It’s not right. They never consulted the Lord by the ark, but we must do it.” Now, that’s correct, what they should done. He said, “We should go get the ark, and we can consult the Lord.” And that’s right, it was down in the other country. Said, “We got to bring it up here. Get it up here and put it in our house here, and worship the Lord.” Now notice he went in the wrong channel to do it. He consulted the captains of fifties and hundreds and thousands. They all was consulted, every one. Seeing it was the will of the Lord, looked like, or it was the Word of the Lord. The Word of the Lord, sometimes, you have to put It in Its right place or it’s not the Will of the Lord. See? Now let that soak deep and you’ll get a general conception of what I’m trying to say. I don’t want the church to fall into the steps that you found over there in England: long hair, and painted-face men, and pervert. We don’t want that! No matter how religious it sounds, and how much Elvis Presley can sing religious songs, he’s still a devil. And I’m no judge, but “By their fruits you know them.” See? He’s a Pentecostal, but that don’t make a bit of difference. See, your fruits bear record of what you are. No matter if the Spirit comes upon him, he could speak in tongues, he could shout, he could heal the sick, and Jesus said, “Many of them will come to Me in that day, and say, ‘Lord, haven’t I done this and that?’ And I’ll say, ‘Depart from Me, you that work iniquity, I never even knew you.’” See? We’ve got to be real, genuine Christians, and the only way we can do that is confront it with this question here of “Eternal Life.” There’s only one form of Eternal Life, and that comes from God. And He foreordained every creature that would ever have It. Just as you were the gene in your father, you was a gene in God; one of His attributes to begin with, or you’ll never be There. You come forth in the bedding ground of your mother; your father didn’t know you, you were in his loins. And when you come forth in the bedding ground of the mother, then you become a human being and are made in the image of your father, now you can fellowship with him. And the same thing by God, if you got Eternal Life. The life that you come in, the natural life, physical life, that was by your father. And the only way you can come born again, is the only way, is it has to be from your Heavenly Father, His attributes. “All the Father has given Me will come to Me.” See? You are here because your name were placed on the Lamb’s Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world. That’s exactly right. You’re a gene, a spiritual gene out of your Heavenly Father, a part of God’s Word. That be so, as I’ve said, then you was with Jesus when He was here because He was the Word: you suffered with Him, died with Him, buried with Him, and rose with Him, and now setting in Heavenly places in Him! Notice, David thought everything was fine, and he consulted all these people, and they every one begin to dance and shout and scream. They had all their religious motions that there was, but still it wasn’t God’s will to go down and bring the Word of God back to the house of God. But, you see, God always (in all ages) works through one way. His first decision is His only decision, because He’s perfect in His decisions. He never does nothing except He first reveals it to His servants, the prophets. That’s exactly. That’s why this, the church age that we live in. There’s no church, no Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostals, or anything else, can ever put this Church into the Bride. It’ll have to be the answering of Malachi 4, for God to send a prophet to be revealed to, ’cause that’s the only way. Our churches denominate and throw the thing into a mess and huddle, just like they’ve always been, and God always sends the prophets. And there was Nathan standing in the land, a vindicated prophet before God, and he wasn’t even consulted. And they went down there and cost the life of a honest man, and so forth, and took the ark. Instead of putting it on the shoulders of the Levites, to pack it, they put it on a cart to pack it. Altogether messed up! You see, if you don’t go according to the will of God, and the way that God has give us to go, they always get It messed up and take It off in some organization, denomination, some message, and there you go. See? It’s always been done that way. That’s the same thing that this boy was confronted with. He come in; he had been a member of maybe the Pharisees or Sadducees, or some great order of that day. He was religious as he could be. He said, “I’ve observed these commandments I’ve been taught, since I was a youth.” See? And Jesus loved him for it. But he refused to be guided, he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him Eternal Life. Notice, he believed there was something different than what he had, or he would have never said, “Good Master, what must I do now?” See, he wanted to do something himself. That’s the way we do, we want to do something ourself. The Gift of God is a free gift. God give It to you, you don’t do one thing for It. He ordained It to you, and you’re going to have It. See? Notice, he knew It was there. He believed in It and wanted It. But when he was confronted with how he had to do it, it was different from his ritual. It was different. He could hold his money and belong on to the church that he belonged to, and so forth. But Jesus knew that, and knew that he had hoarded this money, and He said, “Go sell all you got, and give it to the poor. And come, take up your cross and follow Me, and you’ll have treasures in Heaven.” But he couldn’t do it. The other leaders that he had had in his youthful days, had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God’s provided Way, which was Jesus Christ; the only One who holds Eternal Life, the only One that can give you It. Not the church can give you Eternal Life; not your neighbor; not your pastor; not your priest; not your creed; only Jesus Christ Himself can give you Eternal Life. He’s the … No matter how good you are, what you quit doing, what you start doing, you’ve got to accept the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. And then when you do that, He is the Word, and then your life fits right in the Word and It manifests Itself to this age that you’re living in. Noah had to do that for the Word to be manifested in his age. Now, what if Moses come along, said, “We know what Noah done, we’ll take Noah’s word. We’ll do it just the way Noah did it. We’ll build a ark and float down the Nile River, and go out of Egypt”? Why, it wouldn’t worked. See, that was another age. Jesus couldn’t have come with Moses’ message; Luther couldn’t come with the Catholic message; Wesley couldn’t come with the Luther’s message; the Pentecost couldn’t come with the Wesley age message. And the Bride can’t be formed in the Pentecostal denomination, it just can’t do it. And that’s exactly right. She’s done organized and went out here, and there she sets, just like the rest of them. It’s a shuck. Just like the life comes up through the … See? That writer, as I spoke the other night, that writer that wrote this book … And not ’cause he criticized me so bad, said I was “a devil, if there was such a thing.” So he said he didn’t believe in God. He said, “A God that could fold His arms and set up and watch them martyrs, through the early ages, and claim to have power to open the Red Sea, and let them women and children be tore to pieces by lions and so forth, and then said He was a loving God.” Said, “There’s no such a creature.” See, the fellow, without inspiration of the Word, fails to see It. The first corn of wheat, the Bridegroom, had to fall into the earth in order to rise again. So did the first Bride that was born at Pentecost had to go through that Dark Ages like any other seed, be buried. They had to die. They must do it. But it started sprouting again in Luther, in the first reformation. It didn’t look like the seed that went in, but it was the Light of that day. The …?… stalk then went on into the tassel, Wesley. And from the tassel it went into Pentecost, the shuck. When you see into the wheat, when it comes forth, the corn of wheat, a man that’s raised wheat, you go out and see that wheat form in there, it looks just exactly like the grain. But if you’ll take a tweezer and set down and take that wheat and open it up, there’s no grain there at all. It’s just a shuck. And then what? It’s formed there, to hold the grain. See? And then, the first thing you know, the life left the stalk to go into the tassel; left the tassel go into the shuck; it leaves the shuck and goes into the wheat. Three stages, see, of it. And then forms the Wheat outside of the three stages (Luther, Wesley, Pentecost). Just exactly. See, no doubt. You can’t interrupt nature. Now look, every three years after a message has went forth sent from God, they organize. This has been twenty years, and there’s no organization. It won’t. See? Now the shuck has to pull away, give the Wheat a chance to lay before the Son, to ripen; the Message coming right back into the Church again, forming the Body of Jesus Christ just like the first original One that went into the ground. Now, to see the Eternal Life. The Life, sure the stalk back here carried the Life. Certainly, it did. But, you see, when it become the stalk and it was finished, the organization, the Life went right on into Wesley; come right out, went in. And once, each one of them. One, a big blade, don’t look like the grain. But when the little pollen comes, like the … on the shuck … or on the stalk, the pollen of the tassel, it looks a whole lot like the grain. But when it comes down to that shuck, it’s almost there. Didn’t Jesus say, “In the last days” (Matthew 24:24) “the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes, predestinated, the Elected Ones, if it was possible”? Almost like the real thing, see. So, in the last days. Now, you see, it’s wheat time now. It’s getting harvest time. This is not Luther’s age, this is not Pentecost age, this is the Bride age. As Moses called a nation out of a nation, Christ today is calling a Church out of a church, you see; the same thing in type, taking them to the glorious Eternal Promised Land. Now, to refuse that Person that’s doing the calling, Christ, no matter if you’re Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you got to … This age! Nothing against them, not at all, but in this age now you’ve got to accept (like they did in that age) the Person of Christ which is the Word! In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, …  … the same yesterday, … today, and for ever. Hebrews 13:8. See, you must accept that Person of Eternal Life! Now, what Life Luther had, was justification. Wesley had sanctification, added to it. The Pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back in it, added to it. But now it’s completing in the body, you see, the three phases of it, and out of that … Now, when the resurrection comes, the Life that lived in them Lutherans, that’s went out, the Life that lived in the Methodists and went out, the Life that went into Pentecostals, will all be raptured out of the ground in the Body of the Bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ. Glory to God! Oh, it’s exciting! It’s the Truth! We’ve turned a corner! We’re looking towards Heaven, watching for the coming; the Cap on the Pyramid, as we would say, His coming back! The Church must be resurrected soon, and we must get ready. And the only way you can, is not say, “Well, I belong to the Assemblies. I belong to the Oneness, Twoness,” or whatever it is, all them there, “I belong to the church of God,” that don’t mean a thing. “Our fathers shouted and danced,” that’s just perfectly all right, that was their day. But today you’re confronted not with the organization that they made, but with the Life that’s going on, which is Jesus Christ. This young fellow had done the same thing. Moses wrote those commandments. But, you see, the same God that wrote the commandments, by His prophet, was the same thing that prophesied the day would come, “I’ll raise up a Prophet likened unto me. And it’ll come to pass that all that don’t hear Him will be cut off”; back in the denominational shucks and tassels. They must go on to Life. And today, don’t say, “I’m Pentecost. I belong to this, I belong to that.” That don’t mean nothing. You’ve got to accept the Person Christ, Eternal Life. Confronts every one of us! Don’t forget that. The other leaders, you see, they had such a hold on him. Their peoples is taught, “Well, we belong to this, and we belong to that,” and had such a hold on him. But what a fatal thing, to reject the leadership of Eternal Life! Now, that Life is present tonight. That’s right. The Holy Spirit is here, which is Christ in Spirit form; His Spirit, the anointing is here.  … a little while, and the world seeth me no more; yet ye will see me: …  … For I’ll be with you, even in you, to the consummation, to the end of the world. Jesus alone can lead you to that Eternal Life. There’s no church, no denomination, no preacher, no priest, no nothing else can lead you to It, you must be led by Him, the only One that can lead you. Could you imagine Him leading you out of His Word, which that’s Him? And if He is the Word, and you’re a part of Him, won’t you be a part of the Word? The Word that God wants to pour the waters of salvation upon today, to identify Him today; like the apostles identified Him, like Luther, like Wesley, like in the people in them days identified Him. This is another age. It’s the Word! The Word said these things that we’re seeing taking place now, is predicted to take place in this hour. So accept Jesus Christ and let Him lead you to Eternal Life. Though he had achieved, this young fellow … He had achieved all good things. In school, been fine. As a good boy, no doubt, he had been good. As a real father … In listening to his daddy in business, he had been a good boy. Good to his parents. He had been loyal to his priest. He had been loyal to his church. He had been loyal to the commandments of God. But he lost the greatest thing, and the rest of them didn’t mean very much to him when he turned down the leadership of Eternal Life, Jesus Christ. Notice! This leadership confronts every one of us today, the same thing as it did that young man, we … no matter how religious we are. You may be Catholic, you may be Baptist, Methodist, or you may be Pentecostals, or whatever you are, this same thing confronts you tonight: Eternal Life, that’s, acceptance of Jesus Christ. We are given this opportunity. Sometime in life we have to confront the thing just like this young man did, because you are a mortal being and you are given the opportunity of choice. You have a choice. God made it so you can choose. If He put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose, and then they made the wrong choice, and, see, He can do no more to you than He did to them. He’s got to put you the same thing so you can choose or reject. You have a choice. Let’s look at some of them: You have a choice, as a young man, whether you’re going to have an education or not. You have that choice. You can want to be “just not have it,” you can just refuse it. You have a choice of your conduct. I’m going to hurt just a little bit here. See? You can go out and let your hair grow down and be a Beatle or some of these ignoramuses. Or you women, you can look like a decent human being or you can be one of these weird creatures that we have out there, them blued eyes. And water-head haircuts and things, they’re completely against the Word of God, which is absolutely contrary; not even offer … couldn’t offer a prayer to be accepted. That’s the Truth. That’s exactly right. That’s what the Bible said. But what’s happened to you, church? You’ve seen so much television, so much things of the world, it’s so easy for your old Adam nature to drift into that, to act like the rest of them. May I repeat this again! In the kosher, in the offering of the atonement in the days of Moses, when Moses brought the children out, there was to be seven days that there was to be no leaven among the people. Anyone knows that. In Exodus, “No leaven shall be found in your camp at all, seven days.” That seven days represented the full “seven church ages.” See? “No leaven.” Now, what is that? No creed, no world. Jesus said, “If you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God’s not even in you.” See? And we’re trying to mix that; you can’t do it! You’ve got to come to one thing to believe: you’re either going to believe God, you’re going to believe your church, you’re going to believe the world, you’re … You cannot mix it together. And you can’t hold to them old things that the other church before you did. You’ve got to take the Message of the hour. He said, “What was left over, don’t let it stay till morning (to come into this other age), burn it with fire; be destroyed.” That the age that you’re living in, the Message of this age, It’s got to be brought out of the Scriptures and vindicated and proved by God that it’s God doing so. Then you either receive That or reject It. That’s Eternal Life, leadership of the Holy Spirit, leading His Church. We could stay on that a long time, but let’s move, just keep moving along. The choice of your conduct. You could … You can’t mix it now. You’re either for God or against God, and the outward expressions shows exactly what’s on the inside. See? The cocklebur … Many of you think, “I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I’m going to Heaven.” That don’t mean one thing that you’re going to Heaven. No, sir. You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life, and still be lost and go to hell. The Bible says so. Uh-huh, that’s exactly right. Look here, you are a outside person. You have five senses that contacts that outside body. God gave you five senses; not to contact Him, your earthly home: see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. Then you have a spirit on the inside of that, and it has five outlets: conscience, and love, and so forth. Five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that, but with your spirit. Your physical contacts the physical. Your spiritual contacts the spiritual. But inside of that you’ve got a soul, and that soul is that gene that come from God. And like a baby formed in its mother’s womb. When the baby comes to the mother’s womb by the little germ, it crawls into the egg. It doesn’t form one cell a human, the next a dog, and the next a cat, and the next a horse. It’s all human cells because it’s building off of an original human cell. And when a man has been borned again by the Word of God, predestinated to Eternal Life, called “The Elected,” it’ll be Word of God on top of Word, Word on Word! Not a denominational creed and then a Word, and a creed; and it won’t work. You can’t have that leaven in It! Only one Eternal Life, Jesus Christ the Word: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, … Friends, you feed my children. You send me across the mission fields to the world, to bring the Message. I got to be sincere with you. What I’m looking at, maybe you don’t see. That’s what I’m here to try to tell you. It’s not because I don’t love people, it’s because I do love people. Corrective. When I see the slipping of the church, going off, say, “Well, we did this and we did that,” and look around over the church and see the … It just won’t work. Then look here in the Bible and see it’s got to be that way at the end, that lukewarm Laodicean Church Age, putting Jesus out (the Word). He never called … He ain’t going to call no church. He said, “As many as I love, I rebuke. I chasten them.” Taking the Word and pound It on, and telling, “You’re wrong in it!” That’s the reason I love you. “If you’ll open the door and let Me in, I’ll come in and sup with you.” Not a church, He’s done put out of that. She’s headed for the Ecumenical Council. That’s where she’s gone, right back into Rome where she come from. And that’s exactly. I’ve got that wrote on paper from twenty-five years ago, or thirty-three years ago, and there it is. Not only that, it’s wrote in the Bible, from a vision. She’s gone back. There’s no way of saving it, it’s gone! It’s going to be that way. God’s calling individuals. “I stand at the door and knock. If any man, any person … ” One individual out of a thousand, it might be one out of a million. As I said a few nights ago. When Israel come up out of Egypt, there were just two million people come, and just two million; just one … just two people went in. One out of a million. Did you know that? Caleb and Joshua. And Jesus, when He was on earth, they said, “Our fathers eat manna in the wilderness. We’re keeping the traditions. And we’re doing this. We know where we’re standing!” He said, “I know your fathers eat manna in the wilderness, and they’re every one Eternally separated. They’re dead!” When the sperm comes from the male or female, there’s a million eggs comes, there’s a million germs come. And out of all them little germs, of the kind … If it’s from the male cow, or the man, or whatever it is, there’s just millions of germs, a million germs working. In there there’s only one of those germs that’s ordained to life, for there’s one egg over there, fertile, to meet it. That’s right. Only one egg it’ll meet. Just like this body here setting here, and the germ comes from God. See? And watch that little germ come up among all these other germs, and wiggle around them, right on past them, go over here and find that fertile egg and crawl right into it; and the rest of them dies. What if it was that way with the church today, one out of a million? See where it would be? “Strait is the gate and narrow is the Way, and few there’ll be that’ll find It; because broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there’ll be that go in thereat.” “Is that truth, Brother Branham?” I don’t know, but I’m just quoting Scripture. See? Now, you’re ordained to Life. You see It if you’re ordained to see It. If you’re not ordained to see It, you won’t see It. Said, “They have eyes but they can’t see, ears and can’t hear.” How thankful you should be, church! How you should straighten yourself up from these things! How you should be on fire for God! That your eyes beholds what you see, your ears hears the things you see. Leadership! Why did you come here tonight to hear a Message like This? I’m branded across the world, by the churches, as a “fanatic.” Why did you come? The Holy Spirit led you here (see? see?) to listen. Circumcise! Cut away the things of the world, accept the leadership of Jesus Christ, or you’ll perish as sure as the world. You have a choice of conduct. How you conduct yourself, that’s up to you. You have a choice of wife. You go out and take your wife. You want to take a wife, you want to take one that’s complementary to your … to what you want your … plan your future home to be. Could you imagine a man, a Christian man, going out and taking one of these modern Rickettas for a wife? Huh? Could you imagine? What’s the man thinking about? What kind of a home is he going to have if he takes a striptease, a burlesque off of the street out here, a street prostitute? “Oh,” you say, “now, wait a minute.” How does she dress herself? See? See? Wear shorts and things, she’s a street prostitute. “Oh,” you say, “now, Brother Branham!” Oh, them little ol’ tight skirts, look like you’re poured into, street prostitute. Jesus said, “Whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery with her in his heart.” Then he’s got to answer for that. And what’d she do? She presented herself. Who’s guilty? Think of it. You say, “They don’t make any other clothes.” They got goods and sewing machines. No excuse. Huh-uh. That’s exactly. Now, I don’t want to hurt you. And this is not a joke, this is THUS SAITH THE LORD from the Scriptures. It’s exactly true, friend. I’m an old man, I haven’t got much longer to stay, but I’ve got to tell you the Truth. If this is my last message, it’s the Truth. See? Don’t, sister. Don’t, brother. And you fellows that’s hanging onto a creed, and knowing the Word of God being vindicated right before you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost and these realities that we have today, and then, because of your creed, turn away from It? How can you be a son of God and deny the Word of God that’s predicted for this last days that we’re living in? How can you do it? How can the Bible call this … As I said last night about a king one time, down in the South, when they had the colored down there was sold for slaves. Why, they was no more than just a used car market, you get a bill of sales on them. And I was alarmed, at a little place … I read one day where a broker come along to buy some, and he said, “Well, now, I’d like … ” They was sad, you’d have to whip them, make them work because they was away from home. They was sold, slaves. And they in a foreign country they knowed nothing about, and they’d never be back home again, and they were sad. You had to whip them, make them work. But this broker come by a certain plantation. One young fellow there with his chest out, his chin up, you didn’t have to whip him. He was right up, and he kept the morals of the rest of them up. The broker said, “I’ll buy him.” He said, “He’s not for sale. Ain’t going to. You ain’t going to buy him, because he’s not for sale.” He said, “Well, what makes him so much different?” Said, “Is he the boss over the rest of them?” Said, “No.” Said, “Do you feed him different?” Said, “No. He’s a slave, he eats out there in the galley with the rest of them.” Said, “What makes him so much difference?” He said, “I wondered myself, till I found out. Over in Africa (where they come from, where the Boers bought them, and brought them over here and sold them for slaves), over there his father is a king of the tribe. And yet, an alien, away from home, he knows he’s the son of a king. So he conducts himself that way.” What a rebuke to Christianity! We’re supposed to represent God and Eternal Life. There’s only one form of Eternal Life, and that’s God. He alone has Eternal Life. And we are products of His, because we’re genes of His Spirit. Then we should conduct ourself, women and men, like the Bible said for us to do. Not Jezebels of the street, and Rickies of the organization; but Christian gentlemen, sons and daughters of God, borned of the Spirit of God, manifesting the Light in our days and scattering It. That’s exactly right. How far we’ve drifted from It! Why? The same thing this boy did here. He rejected, refused Eternal Life, because It would cost him his social standing, It’d cost him his luxury of money, It’d cost him his fellowship in the church, It’d cost him a lot of things. He knowed what It was going to cost him, he was a sensible boy, and he felt that he couldn’t pay the price. Yet he thought, “I’ll just trust my religion and go on.” But down in his heart he knowed there was something about Jesus Christ was different from them priests of that day. And any Message that’s come in, a genuine, borned Message of God, is different from the old trend. When a Divine healing went forth, not long ago, did you notice how the impersonators followed it? See? And every one of them’s right in them organizations, staying there. Does anyone know that there had to be a Message follow that? Why, God don’t entertain us! He attracts our attention with something, and when He attracts our attention, then He’s got His Message. Look when He was first come on the earth, and started His ministry, “O young Rabbi, we want You over here in our church. We … Come on down here.” The young Prophet. “Oh, we want You over here. Come here.” But one day He stood up and said, “I and My Father are One.” “Oh, my! He makes Hisself God.” “Except you eat the Flesh of the Son of man and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.” “He’s a vampire! We have nothing to do with that.” Them apostles set right there; thousands left Him, but those apostles were ordained to Life. He said so. They couldn’t explain It; they believed It. They stayed right with It because, said, “No man could do these works.” Even the priests knowed that. Nicodemus said, “We know” (the Sanhedrin council) “that no man could do these works except it be from God.” See? Peter, on the Day of Pentecost, said, “Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God among you. God was with Him.” Look in the Scriptures, what the Scriptures said would do. Jesus said, “Search the Scriptures, in Them you think you have Eternal Life. They are what testifies of Me. If you would have knowed Moses, you’d know Me, for Moses wrote that I would come, in the form that I would come in.” He come as the Son of man. He comes in three names, as God. Three (like Father, Son, and Holy Ghost), same God, it’s three attributes. Now then, also, justification, sanctification … ; Luther, Martin, and the Pentecostal; same thing: three attributes, three stations, three church ages. Same thing: water, blood, and spirit. Oh, just as you go along, the three elements that takes you back into the body. Like it brings you from your natural birth, types your spiritual birth. The baby’s born, the first thing’s water, next blood, and then life. That’s the way you come into the Kingdom of God, the same way. See? That’s the way the Church comes in, the same way. Same thing. Now notice on these three things, God has formed His … forming His body. Now we find that in here, that you have a right in your choice. You choose the girl you want to marry; she accepts you, all right. Then another thing, you have a choice of whether you want to live or whether you don’t want to live. You choose now between Life and death. You can live. That boy had that choice. He was success in everything else, a religious man, but he knowed that when that … He spoke it of hisself, “I’ve observed all these commandments since I was a youth,” but he knowed he didn’t have Eternal Life. See? And he had a choice to accept It or to refuse It, and he turned It down. That was the most fatal mistake he could ever made. The rest of it wouldn’t amounted. It don’t, it doesn’t amount, unless you take That choice. Now let us follow him at his choosing, and see where it led him to. Now, see where he chose. Now, look, he was a rich man, he was a businessman, he was a ruler, and he was a religious man. All that! Today we’d say, “Boy, he’s a genuine Methodist, or Baptist, or a Pentecostal. He’s a real fellow, real nice boy. Fine!” Nothing you could say about him; friendly, nice, sociable, and everything. No immorals about him. He didn’t probably smoke, drink, or run around to shows and dances, and whatever we’d call it today, as we would class a Christian. But that ain’t Eternal Life yet! That ain’t what we’re talking about. He might have been loyal to his church, in which he probably was. But, you see, and what did it lead him to? Great popularity. Let’s say, if he was a preacher, he could been … got a better church. He could been the state presbyter or a bishop. See? It leads you to popularity, and it led him to riches and to fame. It might do the same thing today, you have a great talent to sing. I thought of that young man a while ago that sang that song here; how he had give that to the devil, and now he get it back … And how different between him and Elvis Presley and some of these. Pat Boone, and a group like that, Ernie Ford, them guys, great singers; and take their talents, that God-given talents, and use it to inspire the works of the devil. That’s right. Some great singer selling their God-given talents for fame in this world, to become somebody. How could you become any more of a “body” than you could, to be a somebody, than to be a son of God? I don’t care if you own the whole city, the whole world, and you haven’t accepted the leadership of Eternal Life by the Holy Spirit (Christ), how you going to … Who are you, anyhow? You’re a dead mortal, dead in sin and trespasses! Religious as you want to be; as faithful as you want to be to the church; preacher, if you want to be in the pulpit; but to turn down, you die! He was a great success. He was a great success here in this life. Certainly. We find him where we notice … Then we find this fellow, that he went … We follow him a little bit, and we see he got a great successful. And we follow him through the Bible. We notice that he … We find him a rich man. He’s got such great big places, he was entertaining the judge and the mayor of the city, or whatmore. He’s up on top of his roof, and he has great banquets; and plenty of waitresses, and women, girls, and everything else, around him. And there’s a beggar laying at the gate, named Lazarus. He sweeps the crumbs off to him. We know the story. The next thing, he goes on successful, just like the churches today are getting. A businessman setting here, telling me, “Right here in California, that the church has to tell the labor union what to do.” See, it’s coming church and state again. It’s right on you. You see, you’re right in there, and you take the mark of the beast not knowing it. If you ever bought one of my tapes, get this, when I get home, The Trail Of The Serpent; and you’ll see where it’s at, see where this ends up at. Going home now to speak, if the Lord willing. It’s about four hours, so I couldn’t keep it at one of the meeting like this. I have to go up there where the church suffers with me so long, patiently. Notice. But now you can listen at the tape sometime in your home. Notice this, now we find out that he was a great success. Then we find him later till he was a greater success, until he said, “I have got so much!” Boy, he’d made a real genuine guy of this day. Wouldn’t he? “Even my barns has swelled out, they’re bursting. And I’ve got so much till I said, ‘Oh, soul, take your rest.’” But, what he done at the beginning, he rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ. His church, his intelligence, his education, and all, had lead him to a success. All the Jews loved him. He give to them, he helped them, he might have done this, that, or the other. But, you see, he rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ, the Eternal Life. And that … The Bible said, He said, “Thou fool, tonight your soul is required.” And now we find him (the next place) in hell; lifting up his eyes and seeing that beggar, that he turned out the street, in the bosoms of Abraham. What a fatal mistake! How that the churches had been all right in the way that they went, but they still hadn’t had Eternal Life. Reminds me of a sermon I preached here not long ago, A Thinking Man’s Filter. You might have had it. I was going, walking through the woods, I was squirrel hunting (this fall) and I looked down. And, of course, I can’t call the cigarette company. You know it. And there laid a cigarette pack laying there. And I just passed by it, looking for … in the woods. And I seen that package laying there, and I looked back again, it said, “A thinking man’s filter, a smoking man’s taste.” I just started walking on through the woods. And Holy Spirit said, “Turn and pick that up.” I reached down and picked it up, “A thinking man’s filter, a smoking man’s taste.” I thought, “American firm here, selling death under disguisement, to their own American citizens.” A thinking man’s filter? You … And a smoking man’s taste? I was at the World Fair, with Yul Bryan … Brynner, and them up there, when he giving all that test. And how he put one cigarette and drawed the … across a marble and took the … Wiped up the nicotine and put it on a rat’s back, a white rat, and in seven days he was so full of cancer he couldn’t walk. And they said, “You know, they say a ‘filter,’” said, “it’s a gimmick, sells more cigarettes.” It takes so much nicotine to satisfy that devil. That’s right. And when you take a filtered cigarette, it takes about four cigarettes to take the place of one. It’s a gimmick to sell you more cigarettes. You cannot have smoke unless you got tar; and tar, you’ve got cancer. See how it is? And the blind Americans, looking for a rabbit to come out of a hat somewhere, they fall for it. You can’t have it; it’s death, I don’t care which way you go, it’s death any way you go. “A thinking man’s filter,” a thinking man wouldn’t smoke at all, that’s right, if he’s got any thoughts at all. Well, I thought that just can comply to the churches. See? I think, has God got a filter? Yes. And every church has got a filter. That’s right. They filter ones that comes in, and they let a lot of death in too. How could you ever draw a denomination through God’s Filter? How could you do it? How could you draw a bobbed-hair woman through that Filter? Tell me. How could you ever draw a woman that wears slacks through There, when “It’s an abomination for her to put on a garment pertains to a man”? See, God’s Filter would catch her out there, It wouldn’t let her come in. (But the church has got their own filters.) So I say that there is a thinking man’s Filter, that’s God’s Word, and It suits a holy man’s taste. That’s right, a holy man; not a church man, but a holy man’s taste. Because It’s pure, holiness, unadulterated Word of God! There is a thinking man’s Filter. And church member, I advise you to use That one. Because it brings in the world, and one lump of it is death. One lump leavens, the one little leaven leavens the whole lump. “Whosoever shall take one Word out of This, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.” At the garden of Eden, what caused death, and all this sorrow, every heartache, every little dying baby, every rattle in the throat, every ambulance screaming, every hospital, every graveyard? Was because Eve doubted one Word (not all of It), it just perverted It. Now, God said, “Man,” there, “he was to keep every Word of God.” Now, that’s the first of the Bible. In the middle of the Bible, Jesus come, and He said, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Not just part of Them, every one. In the last of the Bible, Revelation 22, Jesus give the testimony of Himself. The Revelation of the Bible is Jesus Christ. And He said, “Whosoever shall take one Word out of here, or add one word to It, his part will be taken from the Book of Life.” Now, you go through that thinking man’s Filter, you’ll have a holy man’s taste when you come out of There. Right. You’ll have a saintly taste. Sister, you that wear those clothes, think of it. You’re going to … You say, “I’m virtuous to my husband.” “I’m virtuous to my boyfriend.” “I’m a virtuous girl.” But what about that sinner that looked at you? When he answers for adultery, who did it? See, you’ll be guilty. See it written in the Word, so it’s the … See? Oh, be a thinking woman. Be a thinking … You might say, “It might … ” Well, what if it does happen to be that way? He said so, and one Word can’t fail. See? The great man told me not long ago, called me into his room, said, “I’m going to lay hands on you, Brother Branham. You’re ruining your ministry, preaching such things.” I said, “Any ministry that the Word of God will ruin, ought to be ruined.” See? He said, “I’ll lay hands on you.” Said, “You was sent to pray for the sick.” I said, “Do you believe those things, brother?” He said, “No. But it’s not our business.” I said, “Whose business is it, then?” See? “Well,” he said, “that’s the pastor’s business.” I said, “Look at the congregation.” Uh-huh. That’s right. See? Every year I pass through preaching these things, and I think, “Surely they get It,” next year I come back, there’s more than ever. See? That’s right. It goes to show that “Many are called but few are chosen.” The leadership is the Holy Spirit, friend. It leads you and guides you into all Truth, when He the Holy Ghost is come. Now think of that. Take the thinking man’s Filter, that’s the Bible. Not your creed, not your church; you’ll be lost. Take the thinking man’s Filter. That’s where that boy didn’t think. He took the church filter. He become popular, a great man, “But in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment.” Now you take the thinking man’s Filter, Jesus Christ, the Word, and you’ll desire a holy person’s taste, because It’ll satisfy that. If you got the Holy Spirit in you, This satisfies it. If the Holy Spirit isn’t there, you say, “Oh, well, I don’t think that means any difference.” Look what you’ve done right there! Same thing Eve done. You’re right back in the same place. Now let’s go a little farther. Now let’s take … leave that man there, that didn’t use the thinking man’s Filter. He refused to accept the leadership of Jesus Christ, to Eternal Life. Now let us take another rich, young businessman, a ruler with the same opportunity that this man had. And accept It, he accepted the leadership of Christ. Now, there’s two of them in the Bible that we’re going to talk about. That one we see that refused It, now let’s take this man: another rich, young businessman, and a ruler. And he accepted the Leadership. The Scriptures tell us about this fellow, if you want to mark it down, in Hebrews 11: 23 to 29.  … Moses, by faith, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter; Choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of God … Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the treasures of Egypt: … See, he accepted Eternal Life. Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the treasures the world had. Moses esteemed That the greatest. Now, this rich man didn’t. And Moses was a rich, young ruler, to become a Pharaoh. He was Pharaoh’s son, and was heir to the throne. And he looked out to the impossible, a bunch of mud-daubers, a bunch of slaves. But by faith he saw the promise of God, through the Word, “That his people would sojourn in a strange land for four hundred years, but would be brought out by a mighty hand.” And he esteemed That (hallelujah) greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, for he forsook Egypt not knowing where he was going. He was led by Christ. He forsook! And he had his foot on the throne, and he could been the next Pharaoh in Egypt. But he esteemed the reproach of Christ. The reproach! To be called that “odd one,” be called that “fanatic,” to take his place with the mud-daubers and the fanatics; because he seen that the hour, that the Scripture was promised to be fulfilled, was there then. And O church, wake up! Can’t you see the same thing tonight? The hour that’s been promised is on us. Esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything; if it takes father and mother, church, anything else. Follow the leadership of the Spirit! Let us follow this Christ for a few, this Moses, for a little while, that did that; let’s watch his life. The first thing, when he had accepted to take the reproach of Christ and forsake his education, forsake all of his wisdom … He was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. And all of his popularity, his throne, his scepter, his kingship, his crown, everything he had, he rejected it! And this other fellow wanted it, and refused Christ; and this man refused that, and accepted Christ. And quickly what happened? He had to separate himself. Hallelujah! The word means “Praise our God!” It’s too bad that we’re forgetting it. He rejected the thrones and the popularity. He could had young girls by the … wives by the hundreds, and he could had scepters under Egypt, rule the world! The world laid right at his feet, and he was heir to every bit of it. But by looking in the Scripture and seeing the day he was living in, and knowed that Something in him, that predestinated Seed of God went to work! I don’t care how popular you could be, or how this you could be, you could be a presbyter, you could be a pastor, you could be a this, that, or the other, but if that Word of Eternal Life by God’s Word has been foreordained into you, and you see the thing at hand, it goes to work, moving out like that. [Brother Branham snaps his finger several times] Start coming out! Begin to get It! And he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, because he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt or the world. He esteemed That. Watch what he done, he followed It. Up, quickly he was ousted from his people, the people that once loved him. It might cost you everything you got. It might cost you your home, It might cost you your friendship, It might cost you your stitch-and-sew party, It might cost you your place at the Kiwanis. It might. I don’t know what It’ll cost you, but It’ll cost everything that’s worldly or pertains to the world. You’ll have to separate yourself from everything that’s worldly. You’ll have to do it. Moses laid everything aside and went into the desert with a stick in his hand. Amen! Days after days passed. And wonder if he thought he made a mistake? No. Many times people start out, and they say, “Oh, I’ll do it. Glory to God, I see It!” Let somebody laugh at you and make fun of you, “Probably I was wrong.” He said, “They that cannot stand chastisement are bastard children and not the children of God.” See, they’re worked up on the emotion. See, the seed that I talked about a while ago, that soul wasn’t there to start with. It was anointed with the Spirit, and he done all kinds. Oh, you, they … When your spirit’s anointed, you can … It’s the real, genuine Holy Ghost, and you could still be a devil. “Oh,” you say, “Brother Branham!” False prophets! The Bible said, “In the last days there’d be false prophets.” Jesus said, “There shall rise false christs.” Not “false Jesuses,” now, nobody stands still for that; but “false christs.” Christ means “the anointed ones.” Falsely anointed; they are anointed, but they are false at the bottom of it, and do great signs and wonders, speak in tongues, dance in the Spirit, preach the Gospel. Judas Iscariot did it! Simeon … or no, I beg your … Caiaphas prophesied! Balaam, the hypocrite! Sure, done all the signs, everything, all the religious moves. But, you see, you put a cocklebur seed and a wheat seed in the same bed and pour the water down upon them and anoint them, they’ll both rejoice. They’ll both grow by it, the same water. “The sun shines on the just and the unjust, and the rain falls on the just and the unjust, but by their fruits you shall know them.” How can you keep from lining up with the Word? Amen. See what I mean? “The water falls on the just and the unjust,” anointed. Jesus said, “They will come to Me in that day, say, ‘Lord! Lord! Have not I cast out devils? Have not I done prophesied? Have not I done great things in Your Name?’” He’ll say, “You workers of iniquity, depart from Me, I don’t even know you. Go into eternal hell that’s been prepared for the devil and his angels.” You see? What a Word! Falsely. Worship in vain, striving in vain. Why do you do that when you don’t have to do it? Why take a substitute when the Heavens is full of genuine? See? You don’t have to do that. Now we find Moses anointed, nothing could turn him back. His own brothers turned him down; that didn’t stop him. He went right on into the wilderness. And one day out there, he met God face to face, with a Pillar of Fire hanging in a bush. Said, “Moses, take off your shoes, your ground you’re standing on is Holy. For I have heard the cries of My people, and I have heard of their groanings, and I remember My promise of the Word. And I’m coming down, I’m going to send you down there to take them out.” Certainly. He met God face to face, he talked with Him. He was commissioned by God. God come right back, that same Pillar of Fire, and vindicated that prophet standing right there on the mountain; to prove that it was, when He took his hands and performed all kinds of miracles and things. Oh, they had the impersonators. Oh, sure. There was Jambres and Jannes, stood right around, done the same thing they did. But who was the original? See? Where did it start from? Did it come from the Word? Was it the hour? And do you know that same thing’s promised again in the last days? “As Jambres and Jannes withstood Moses, so will these men, of reprobate mind concerning the Truth.” See, in the last days. And do the same thing, (impersonate everything), right on in the same gully, “Hog going to its wallow, and a dog to its vomit.” You Pentecostals that come out of them organizations years ago and cursed them, your fathers and mothers; and you turned right back around and done the same thing that they did, and now just the same wallow and vomit. See? If it made the Church vomit it out in the early Pentecostal age, it’ll make It vomit it out again today. See? It has to be, though, it’s the shuck, has to come. The tassel can’t be the only one; the shuck has to come, see, the carrier. Now we’re living in the last days, watch the things that’s promised for the hour. Watch this Moses confirmed. Know! When he got out there, some of his own brethren turned up against him, wanted to make an organization. They said, “You act like you’re the only holy man among us.” “The whole congregation’s holy,” said Korah, Dathan. “Let’s choose out men and do something.” Moses, he … I felt sorry for him. He went down, said, “Lord … ” Fell down before the altar and said, “Lord!” God said, “Separate yourself from them. I’ve had enough of it.” Just opened up the earth and swallowed them up. That’s all. See, he knowed his commission. God don’t deal with organizations, He don’t deal with groups. He deals with individuals. That’s right. Always. Not in groups; individuals, one person. In the last days, He said, “I stand at the door and knock, and if any man … ” (not “any group”) “ … any man will hear My Voice, I’ll … and hear Me, I’ll come in to him and sup.” See, “If any man can hear.” How could this microphone now produce my voice out there unless it was made thus? I could scream against that board, all my might, and it wouldn’t do nothing. Because this is ordained, and made, created, a microphone. And if the Word of God is in you from foreordination of God, in you, “My sheep hear My Voice. They know My hour. A stranger they won’t follow.” See? It’s got to be that first. “All that the Father has given Me, they will come.” Every one of them, see. Now he goes on, at the life’s end here. He only passed … Notice when he come to the end of the road. And we’re closing now because it’s getting late, twenty-five minutes till ten. Notice. Now, at home that’s early. About two or three o’clock we begin to say, “Say, it’s getting a little bit late.” See? See? But now, I’ve preached a many a night, all night long. Paul preached this same Gospel in his day, and a young man fell off of a wall and killed himself. And Paul, with that same anointing, with that same Gospel, laid his body upon him, he come to life again. They were interested. The church was being formed. Something was taking place. Notice what taken place here. Moses, when he come down … This rich man, when he come down, or, young ruler we talked about, all religious, and belonged to church and everything, fine, educated, a fine businessman, and everything, when he come to the end of the road, he begin to scream, “There’s nowhere to step!” Where’s his leadership? He had been led by his church, which is dead. He had been led by the dead world, and there wasn’t nothing for him to step into but what the world had prepared for it: hell. But here comes Moses, a faithful servant who esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures than all the riches of Egypt. He come to the end of the road, an old man, a hundred and twenty years old. Walked up on the mountain, and he knowed that death laid before him, and he looked over into the promised land. And he looked; laying there by his side, there was his Leader, the Rock. He stepped upon the Rock, and the Angels of God packed him away into the Glory of God, into the bosoms of God. Why? Eight hundred years later, he was still being led by his Leader. We find him over on Mount Transfiguration, standing there with Elijah, talking to Jesus before He went to the cross, eight hundred years after death. The One that he esteemed, the reproach of his ministry, greater treasures than all the popularity of the world and all the money of the world, his Leader was still leading him. Oh, my! He was led! His Leader, He led through the death, the shadows of death. He was led to the grave. Hundreds of years later, there he stood again because, as his youth, he had chosen the leadership of the Holy Spirit. His name will be great when there is no more Egypt or treasures. When the pyramids are dust, and when Egypt is no more Egypt, Moses will be immortal among men because he accepted the leadership of Christ instead of going the way his church went. There’s others that did the same thing. Look at Enoch. He walked with God for five hundred years, and then he had a testimony that “He pleased God.” God had verified it, and said, “There’s no need of you dying, just come on up Home this afternoon.” And he went up. And Elijah. After bawling out bobbed-haired women and everything, as he did in his day, Jezebels with the paint on them, after he got so full of it, and had done all he could, and all them priests making fun of him, and everything else, he walked down at the river one day. And just across the river was the horses hitched to a bush over there, a chariot of fire and horses of fire. He stepped right on, and threw his robe off to the next prophet to follow him, and went up into Heaven. He accepted the leadership of Eternal Life, ’cause it was Christ that was in Elijah. Oh! Yes, sir! What was it? “Follow Me!” Now you must choose your leader. You’ve got to choose it, friends. Look in God’s looking glass, the Bible, and see where you’re at tonight. A little story. A little kid, one time, lived out in the country. He never seen a mirror, and he came into the city to see his mother’s sister. And she had a home … and the old-fashioned homes used to have a mirror on the door; I don’t know whether you remember that or not. But this little boy, he had never seen a mirror. So he’s playing around the house, and he looked in the … “Huh?” He looked at that little boy. And he waved, and the little boy waved. And he pulled his ear, and the little boy pulled his ear. And on like that. He kept walking up, close, and he turned around and said, “Mama! That’s me!” That’s me. What do you look like? What are you following? What have we done? You must choose your leader. Choose today. You choose Life or death. Your choice will determine your Eternal destination, what you choose. Remember, Jesus said, “Follow Me.” And you’re invited tonight to do so. And to follow Him to Eternal Life you must come on His terms, that’s right, the Word. Not upon the creed, not upon the public opinion, not upon what anybody else thinks about It, but on what God said about It. You say, “Well, Brother Branham, I know a woman just as good as she can be, she does this. I know a man that went through this.” I can’t help what they done. God’s Word, He said, “Let every man’s word be a lie, and Mine be the Truth.” You’ve got to come on His terms, come on His conditions, the Word. You cannot come through creed. You cannot come through denomination. You cannot mix It like that. There’s only one thing you can do: accept It on His terms, that you’re willing to die to yourself and all your thoughts, and follow Him. “Get rid of all the things of the world, and follow Me.” I know that’s a stern, cutting Message, brother. But I didn’t come here and choose a message to the people just to try to make them sing, shout, holler. I been in heathen meetings where they done the same thing. I’m interested in your life. I’m a servant of God that’s got to answer to God someday, and the ministry that the Lord has given me has vindicated itself thousands of times before you. Remember, Jesus said, “Follow Me. Follow Me. Get rid of what you got, and follow Me.” And that’s the only way to have Eternal Life. That’s the only remedy He give this man, was the only remedy He give this businessman, it’s the only remedy He gives anybody. His choice, He makes His decision, it’s perfect every time. And we must follow Him, is the only way to have Eternal Life. So the leadership of God is: follow the vindicated Word of the hour by the Holy Ghost. Let us bow our heads. I’m going to ask you a question, and I want you to be real sincere. I want the sister to play this for me, I Can Hear My Saviour Calling. I know it’s an old-time altar call. And brother, sister, as we see, just look what’s going on today. Now with your heads bowed, just think for a minute, look what’s taking place. Did you read the newspaper last week what that man in England said? That “The crucifixion of Jesus Christ was only a fake, it was only fixed up between Pilate and Him.” Did you see what this American theologian said? He said that “Jesus was just put to sleep on mandrake weed.” Many of you theologians know, back there in Genesis where it talked of the mandrake weed. It’ll put you to sleep like you’re dead, your heart hardly beats for two or three days at a time. “And when they give Him the vinegar and gall,” they said, “that was mandrake weed. And they put Him up there in the tomb, and He slept up there for three days. And, of course, when they went up there, they found Him walking around.” Could you imagine that? Theologians, seminaries, make-belief. Then how in the world … First place, the Bible said He refused it, when they put the vinegar and gall in His mouth. And another thing, if that be so, then why did those disciples “who come and stole Him away,” why did they give their life in martyrdom for Him? And fell, counted theirself not even worthy to die like He died; turned them upside down and sideways on the crosses and things. And if they were … knowed that He was a hypocrite and them own selves being hypocrites, how would they have give their life for Him like that? Oh, you see, it’s this intellectual day that we’re living in. Education, civilization, and the modern trend of the day, is all of the devil. “Civilization of the devil?” Yes, sir! The Bible said it is. This civilization has death. “Will we have a civilization like this in the other world?” No, sir! We’ll have a different kind of civilization. Education, all these things, they’re of the devil; science perverting the natural things, making something else. Look what they’ve done to you now. When young ladies … The Reader’s Digest said, week after … month before last, I believe it was. The Reader’s Digest said that “Young men and young women go through the middle age, women in menopause between twenty and twenty-five years old.” One more generation, they’ll be nothing but … It’ll be horrible-looking. See? What the creatures will be, softened, mucky. Look at the spirit, look how the spirit in the church has got, hybrid, intermarried to the world. Oh, what a hour! Flee, children! Flee! Flee to the Cross! Come to Christ, let Him lead you. While we have our heads bowed, our eyes closed, and please bow your heart, the same time. Will you? I want to ask you a question. Do you really look at yourself, to God? And do you feel that you’re not where you ought to be at this hour? Cause the Rapture could come at any time. See, it’ll come. There’d only be, if that statement I made a while ago is true, there’ll only be about five hundred people in the Rapture, that’s living, they’ll be changed. Why, taking all Christendom together, Catholic and all, there’s only five hundred million people, see, claims Christianity. And one out of a million, be five hundred people. There’s that many people missing every day, across the world, that we can’t even account for them. See, it’ll come, and you won’t even know it. People’ll go on preaching, and saying … See, and it’ll all be past. Like Jesus said. They said, the disciples said, “Why say the scribes, say, ‘Elias must first come’?” He said, “He’s already come and you didn’t know him, but they did to him what they said they would do.” You know that you’re not right with God, and you’d like to be remembered in … to God, that God would set your heart right with God. Would you just humbly now, in this very still moment, raise your hands? I don’t care who you are, would you do it? You say, “I’ll raise my hands to God.” God bless you. God bless you. Are you looking in the Mirror? I ask you in Christ’s Name, are you looking in God’s Mirror? [A brother speaks in another tongue. A brother gives an interpretation] Amen. I want to ask one thing. How many in here are Pentecostals? Raise your hand, are Pentecostals. Practically every one of you. Now, how many in here claim to be Christians? Raise your hands, ever where you are, claim to be a Christian. Did you know the Bible spoke of this, that this would happen? Even this happened in the Old Testament when they were wondering what they would do, how they could get away from the besiege that was coming. The Spirit fell upon a man and he prophesied and told them where to meet the enemy, and how, what to overcome the enemy. That was the Old Testament, same as the New. Now, somebody might say, “That man, oh, that wasn’t so.” But what if it is so? You say, “Oh, I’ve heard that before.” But what if this is so? You see, that proves then that in here there’s many that needs a change of heart, if that’s the Holy Spirit speaking. There’s things that needs to be done, so now it’s with you. Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy Blood was shed for me, And that Thou bids … That’s what, He called you just then.  … to Thee, O Lamb of God, … “I’ll take away that stubborn heart, and put a heart of flesh in it, that will yield to Me.” See?  … come! Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, Wilt … Will you make your choice tonight? You can do either one you want to.  … cleanse. You say, “I’ve heard that before.” But this might be your last time to hear It. Because Thy promise I believe, The old-fashioned altar calls, they’re out of style today, but God still moves in them. Can’t you feel It moving on you, church?  … I come! [Brother Branham begins humming Just As I Am] Oh, think, today, the hearts are becoming stony, filled with the world, indifferent, church members, lukewarm, like that rich, young ruler; and don’t know that the great Holy Spirit’s standing, knocking at the door in this Laodicean Age. “He that will hear My Voice (the Word), will open his heart, I’ll come in to him and will sup with him.” And the Spirit speaking through this brother a few minutes ago, said, “I’ll take that stony heart out of you, and give you a heart of flesh, tender towards God.” Look how it’s become now, just a intellectual, emotion. See? Not a tender heart full of love and sweetness towards Christ. [Brother Branham begins humming the chorus] Don’t you want that kind of a heart? How you going to face Christ with an intellectual conception of Him? You’ve got to accept Eternal Life.  … was shed … The preparation was made through the Blood. And that Thou bids … What did He do? Shed His Blood. And now bidding you, “Come.”  … to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come! I come! Let’s, each Christian, just raise our hands quietly now and pray. O God, please, Lord, catch this day that we’re living. Oh, it’s so hard, Father. Satan has just done so much to the people. Their hearts have become stony. Your Spirit speaks right out; Your Word comes forward, vindicates; but the old-fashioned, born-again experience, they’re … it’s become into a denominational, intellectual conception, a lot of music, a lot of shout, and a lot of carrying-on. But, really, that heart of flesh, that Spirit, that Eternal Life, It’s certainly become foreign to the church. God, it breaks my own heart, and me a sinner saved by Your grace. It makes me feel so bad, Father, to see the church that You died for, the church that You’re trying to redeem. I think of the vision You just give about that church of the United States and of other countries. What a horrible-looking rock-and-roll striptease it was. But somewhere along I seen coming forth another one, blessed. I pray, Father, that if any of those here tonight that’s ordained to Life, or would like to accept It, that this’ll be the hour they’ll do it. Grant it, Lord. Break up the stony heart now, the old heart of the world. And if they want peace, they want something that satisfies, something that gives assurance, may they accept the leadership of Christ tonight to lead them to a Peace that passes all understanding, a Joy that’s unspeakable and full of glory, or even something that death itself cannot harm. Grant it, Father. Now, with our hands up, I wonder if … How many in the building now would just say, “I’m going to stand.” Now, I don’t care who’s setting by you; It’s God talking to you. And you really want to be a real Christian. See? Anything will … Unless that’s an impersonation; oh, I’d just rather go on out and be in the world. I believe you would, too. Now, just examine yourself by the Word, by the Message. Examine what a real Christian should be: rugged, loving, not one of this modern Christianity. Why, it’s soft, flexible, half dead, rotten, interbred. See, it’s not the real Christianity; live any kind of a way, and belong to church. Don’t you want that sweet fellowship with Christ, the Holy Spirit, that you’re … the conformity of your own heart to the Word, move right up into Christ? If you want that, and would desire God to see your stand tonight right in this group of people, if you’ll just do it. You say, “Will that mean anything, Brother Branham?” Oh, yes. Sure, it does. “If you’re ashamed of Me before man, I’ll be ashamed of you before My Father and the holy Angels. But he that will confess Me and stand for Me in this land, I’ll stand for him in that Land. I’ll confess him before My Father.” Now, no matter who you are, woman, man, boy, girl, whoever you are, Christian or not Christian, minister, deacon, whatever you are, if you’ll just believe with your whole heart, for just a moment, and do this much tonight just to let God know that you’re sincere. “God … ” “Now look, I’m a Pentecostal,” you say. “I’m this,” or whatever you are. “I profess to dance in the Spirit. But, Brother Branham, I thought as long as we had that, we had It.” You haven’t. If you believe me to be God’s prophet, you listen to my Words. See? That’s a deception in this day. Didn’t the Bible say, “It’d be so close it would deceive the Elected if possible”? The Elected, “down to the soul.” But if you danced in the Spirit, still with the things of the world, there is something wrong. If you speak with tongues; Paul said, “I can speak with tongues of man and angels, and still not even be saved.” Uh-huh, both kinds, see. “I can do all the emotions, I can have faith, I can preach the Gospel, I can give all my goods to feed the poor, I can carry the Word in the mission fields across the … and still I’m nothing.” See? It’s that Inside of the inside, brother. That … Your spirit breaks up when you die, it takes its flight, but your soul lives. See? Now look at yourself. Really, are you a genuine Bible Christian, full of love of God? You remember, the Bible said, in the last days when this time takes place, He said, “A marking angel went through the churches, went through the cities, and sealed only those who sighed and cried for the abomination that was done in the city.” Is that right? Ezekiel 9, we know that’s Truth. The marking angel went forth and put a Mark on their head, forehead, sealed them, “Them that sighed and cried.” After that come the slaughtering angels from the four corners of the earth, which is coming right away, we see it coming, wars moving right in that’ll kill the whole earth off. There was nothing that they couldn’t touch but them that had the Mark. Now pick out … Is your heart so concerned about the sinners, and the way that the church and the people are doing, till you can sigh and cry about it day and night? If not so, I’m wondering. That’s the Scripture. Would you just stand and say, “Dear God, I’m not standing because Brother Branham said so, but I heard his Word say that, and I’m going to do this. To You, Lord, I stand. I’m in need, Lord. Will You supply my need tonight here at this place? I stand.” God bless you. God bless you. “I’m in need, I want You to have mercy upon me.” God bless you. “I want to be the kind of a Christian that … ” Now, remember, the person that’s standing by you is the same thing you are. I want you just to reach over and take a hold of their hand, say, “Brother, sister, pray for me now. I want you to pray for me. I … ” Just say it with all Christian sincerity, “Pray for me. I’ll … I want to be right with God. You pray for me, I’m going to pray that God will give you the opportunity.” I know that we’re … We can’t stay here much longer; you see that. We’re at the end time. All that believe that, say, “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen!”] We’re … There’s nothing left. Everything is gone. The churches is headed to the Ecumenical council. The world, it … Look here! Do you know what the Lord says about Los Angeles and these places here? “She’s gone!” You remember what I told you, about two years ago, how that earthquake would come in Canada up here, Alaska? I also tell you that “Hollywood and Los Angeles is sliding into the ocean. California, you’re doomed! Not only California; but you, world, you’re doomed! Church, unless you get right with God, you’re doomed!” THUS SAITH THE HOLY SPIRIT! Have you ever heard me use that Name unless it come to pass? Ask you! You’ve known me twenty years. Did I ever tell you anything in the Name of the Lord but what come to pass? If everything I’ve ever told you would happen, happened, say “Amen.” [Congregation says, “Amen!”] See? I tell you, now is the hour, you better be getting right, all of us. Now let’s each one pray for the other: Dear God, as we stand here tonight, a dying people, our faces are turned towards the earth, the dust. We just … You have give us this cutting sermon, Lord. We see the example of two men. One of them, being a religious man, went to church but rejected the leadership to Eternal Life. And the other rejected the worldly fame and turned to Eternal Life. And we see both of their conditions tonight, according to the Bible: the rich man is in torment, and Moses is in Glory. Father, we want to be like Moses. We want to be led by Your Holy Son, Jesus Christ, to Eternal Life. Give It to our hearts tonight, Lord. Tear out the old stony heart; place into us the new heart, the heart of flesh, the heart that You can talk to and deal with, and we will not be haughty or different. May the Holy Spirit never leave, Lord. May It come and ordain this people. Speak to them; tear up their stony wills, and put in the will of God. Save every one, Father. Give us of Thy love. Get us to a place, Lord, that we’ll get away from all the emotional part, to the real solid part of the feeling … the heartfelt part, the deepness of the Spirit, the riches of God, the Kingdom of the Spirit in our hearts. Grant it, O Great Leader, great Holy Spirit, before You take Your flight into the skies with Your Church. O God, let me go, Lord. Don’t leave me behind, Jesus. Let me go with You, Father. I don’t want to stay here on this earth to watch these tribulations coming on. I don’t want to stay here in this insanity. I don’t want to stand here when hideous sights … the people losing their mind. We look at man trying to act like beasts and look like beasts; and the women trying to look like animals, with the paints on their face. Knowing that these things are predicted to happen, that the thing will, they’ll go so insane till locusts will raise up with hair like women to haunt the women; and teeth like lions, and things that You’ve said, the mental condition of the people will be completely gone. We see it in the making right now, Lord. Help us! Restore us to the sane mind of Christ Jesus our Lord. O Great Leader of Eternal Life, we accept Your promise tonight, Father. I plead for this people. I plead for every one of them, in the Name of Jesus Christ, Lord. I pray that Christ the Son of God will come into the hearts of every one of us, Lord, and mold us and make us into new creatures in Jesus Christ. Grant it, Lord God. We love You. And we want our dispositions … our change to come into us, that we can be Your children, feel of Your Spirit moving in our hearts, Lord, tendering us and bringing us to realization of this insane age that we’re living in. Grant it, God. When we see young women so caught up in the web of the devil, young men, perverted minds, children, dope addicts, cigarette smoking, drinking, immoral, Satan’s Eden. God, it taken You six thousand years, according to the Bible, to build an Eden. And You put Your son and his wife in there (his bride), to rule over it. And Satan come around and perverted it; he’s got six thousand years, and he’s built his own intellectual Eden through science, and education, and so-called intelligence, and he’s built it into a mess of death. O God, take us back to Eden again, Lord, where there’s no death, where there’s no sorrow. Grant it, Lord. We stand humbly, waiting for the second Adam to come for His Bride. Make us part of Him, Father. We pray in Jesus’ Name. Amen. Do you love God? Can you feel … Do you realize what I’m trying to tell you? If you can understand, just raise your hands, say, “I understand what you’re trying to say.” Can you see the insanity of this age? Look how it’s gone, there’s no even reasons among the people no more. It’s gone! Where is our … ? Even leaders. Look at our President! “If they want Communism, let them have it. Whatever the people wants, let them have it.” Where is our Patrick Henry’s, our George Washington’s? Where is our leaders that can stand for a principle? We haven’t got them no more. Where is our churches, our ministers? Will take the people in just on probation, or come in, join the church and do this or have a little sensation or something. Where is those men of God, those prophets that stand out and dare to defile, defy all the things of the world? Where is those men of integrity? Where are they at? They’re so soft, and through intellectual conceptions and things, till they’re not here no more. O God, have mercy upon us. These hideous sights that’s coming upon the earth. You can see how the people’s moving right into it. It’s an insanity. But when that thing strikes, the Church will be gone. God, let us be there. That’s my prayer to the great Supernatural Being that’s in this building tonight, the great Christ that still has Eternal Life. I pray Thee, Christ, as I’m here with my eyes open, looking at the church that You’ve redeemed with Your Blood. God, don’t let a one of us be lost. We want to be right with You. So cleanse us, O, Lord, from all of our iniquities. Take away our sins and things. We seen You heal our sick, even raise our dead (come back to life through prayer), and we seen all these things happen, Father. Now bring us back to Life, spiritually; bring us back into realization of Eternal Life through Christ Jesus. Grant this, Father. I commit it all to You. In Jesus Christ’s Name. Till we meet! till we meet! Till we meet at Jesus’ feet; Till we meet! Look to Him. Let Him soften us up.  … we meet! God be with you till we meet again! Raise our hands now: Till we meet! till we meet! Brother Salano, ever who is following. [Someone says, “Anything else?”] No. God bless you. 
Stirring message that Brother Pearry gave us just then from the Word of God. How true it is that “We limit God and time God; and He’s Eternal, we can’t do that.” So tonight we’re facing something else now, is communion. Three years I waited for a church to come in Tucson, but it’s here. Yeah, we’re here. So we thank the Lord, He just let us wait till we can appreciate it now. Now, there’s one thing that I’d want to say just before we start the communion, is this, that I believe that we have seen enough in our day that we live in, that we ought to really give (every) all of our being to God. We should really serve God. I believe that He has blessed us with the direct answer to Scripture. As Brother Pearry gave it a few moments ago, that we are—we’re at that time. We’re not blind, we see that we’re here, we’ve arrived. And we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people. That, we can’t stay too much longer, we’d be in a complete insane institution, the whole world would be. See? So we’re at the end time. Now, as Brother Pearry ended up there, seeing these things are true, see that they are true, they’re not myth. They’re not just something that we imagine. They’re something that’s been directly given to us by the Word of God and manifested publicly before us, that we know we are here. We don’t know how long now, because again we come back to a watch, you see, what time it is. But we are … we know we’re here, we’re at the time. Whether God’s time, I’d imagine … Someone give a little analysis one time that said that if God put up with him according … if He was to allot time, one thousand years is just one day. So if a man lived seventy years old, it’d just be a few minutes of God’s time. See? Well, and said it’d be forty years, that wouldn’t even mean time, hardly, He could bat His eye. See? See, just that’s how quick it is, the whole thing, if it be lotted time; which, He doesn’t have any time. So He just is Eternal. I believe it was Sarah back there … or, no, Joseph, the other night, said to me and Brother Pearry. He said, “Daddy, where, when did God come on the scene? Where did He come from?” See? “He had to have a beginning, didn’t He? Didn’t He have to start?” I said, “No. Anything that has a beginning has an end, but it’s that which had not a beginning has no end.” Of course, he’s ten years old, that was kind of a real mouthful for him. See? And how could he receive that, knowing that something never did begin? Not only to him, it is to me. Now, see, it’s just a great big dose for me, how it did ever begin. Now we’re fixing to observe something here that’s really sacred. I was called on a few days ago, to some very fine Christian gentlemen that’s never had this, and he understood that we taken communion literally. They take it what they call “spiritual communion.” And which, as far as communion, I’d say all right, ’cause communicate is “to talk to,” see. And the brother give me this Scripture, said, “Brother Branham, don’t you think now … ” Now, reason I’m saying this … It’s all right, Brother Pearry? [Brother Pearry Green answers, “Sure.”] See, that reason I’m saying this, so that you would understand what you’re doing. You don’t … if you walk into anything blindly, you don’t know where, what you’re doing. You can’t have even confidence if you don’t know what you’re doing. But you must understand what you are doing and why you’re doing it. He said, “Now if we take the Word of God, isn’t that God that we’re taking?” I said, “Exactly right, sir, it’s true. But we read here that they actually … Paul taught taking the literal Lord’s supper. ‘This do in remembrance of Me,’ said Jesus. ‘As oft as you take it in remembrance of Me, you show forth the Lord’s death till He comes.’” See? Now, we are to take it. We understand that Saint Paul, who ordained it in the Church, being the prophet of the New Testament. Peter, James, John, all of them, they wrote (why, Matthew, Mark, Luke) what Jesus did, as scribes. But Paul set the thing in order, he was he was the prophet of the New Testament. Just as Moses went into the wilderness to receive the inspiration to write the five Books of … the first five Books of the Bible, well, Paul also went into the desert and received inspiration from God, to set the New Testament Church in order and type It with the Old. Under there they had the sacrificial lamb, that Israel kept that for a memorial. It was actually used one time, coming out of Egypt. But then they kept that as a memorial all down through the age. Well, “if the law being a shadow of things to come,” you see. Now, I do believe that communion (what we call “communion,” now) is to … is “the Lord’s supper.” Now, we only have three physical Divine orders left to us: one of them is communion; feet-washing; water baptism. That’s the only three things. That’s the perfection, of the three, see. And that’s the only three orders we have. We realize that that was the issue given by Saint Paul in the New Testament. Now, if we would say “the communion should just be taking the Word,” I don’t believe anyone has a right to take the Lord’s supper until he has taken the Word of the Lord into his heart. See? Because I’m going … I’ll read something for you in a few moments and you’ll see. Now, notice. Then, why then would we would … On the same basis we could absolutely justify the Salvation Army. They do not believe in any form of water baptism, said, “We don’t need it.” Now, if we don’t need water baptism, why are we baptized? Said, “The water can’t save you, the Blood saves you.” I’ll agree with that. That’s right, the Blood saves you, not the water. But we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inwardly work of grace has been done. See? So must we on communion! When we have taken the Lord, our Sacrifice, into us, as a matter of spiritual Birth into us, and His Body, we live by Him by the Word, we also should symbolize it because it’s a commandment. “Repent, every one of you and be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins.” Paul said, “I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, ‘That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread, and brake it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take and eat, this do in remembrance of Me.” For as often as you take this bread, you show forth His death till He comes.’” Now we find out that, in that, they had people who come and … This precious brother, a very dear brother, he came and he said, “I never did take it, Brother Branham, I don’t understand what it is.” Said, “I been taught the other side.” I said, “But remember, we will admit that Saint Paul set it in order in the early Christian Church. They went from church … from house to house, broke the bread with singleness of heart, and so forth. Now,” I said, “he did put it in the Church. Galatians 1:8, he said, ‘If an angel from heaven comes and says anything else, let it be accursed,’ you see, see, the same one that had them to be rebaptized again from the baptism of John, to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ.” You see, there are three things that we must—three things that we must do as symbols: the Lord’s supper, feet-washing, water baptism. See? There’s … You say, “Well, the … ” Now, the Salvation Army takes it from the point, “The dying thief, when he died, he wasn’t baptized, yet Jesus said he would be in Heaven.” That’s exactly the truth. That’s exact. But, you see, he only recognized Jesus right there in the hour he was dying. See? That’s the only—that’s the only opportunity he had. He was a thief, he was away, he was out. And he, as soon as he seen that Light, he recognized It, “Lord, remember me!” And Jesus … That was true. But to you and I who know that we should be baptized, and refuse to do it, then that’ll be between you and God. Same thing in communion! Now, when we take this communion, it isn’t just the thing say, “I’m coming up here and going to eat some bread, and I’ll believe I’m a Christian.” But, if you noticed, the Bible said, “He that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the Blood and the Body of the Lord.” See? You’ve got to live a life that … before the people, that … and before God and the people, that shows that you are—that you are sincere. Now, just a moment longer. Now, in the Old Testament when the sacrifice was made a statute or an ordinance. And so is water baptism an ordinance; so is feet-washing an ordinance; so is the Lord’s supper an ordinance. “Blessed is he that does all of His ordinance, keeps all of His statutes, all of His commandments, that he might have a right to enter into the Tree of Life.” Now, notice in this now, that in that first, when it was first an ordinance of God to bring a sacrifice to the church, and to the temple and the altar, and offer your gift, and for your sins, the sacrifice of a lamb. Well, I can just imagine seeing some Jewish brother coming down the road, knowing that he was guilty, and he goes to the altar; or brings his fat ox or a bullock, or whatever he had, or a ram, lamb, something. He had brought it down the road just as sincere as he could come, he walked up there, keeping God’s ordinance just as sincerely as he could. Then he laid his hands upon it, confessing his sins, and the priest placing this (his sins) upon the lamb, and the lamb’s throat was cut, and then died for him. As he laid there, the little lamb kicking and bleeding, his hands being full of blood, and it flying all over him, (the little lamb blatting, dying), he would realize that he had sinned and something had to die in his place. Therefore, he was offering this lamb’s death for his death. See, the lamb died in his place. Then the man done it with sincerity, with deepness of his heart. Finally, over and over it went again, over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition. The commandment of God became a tradition to the people. And then here he come down, “Well, let’s see, this is so-and-so today, maybe I better go down. Yeah, I better offer a bullock.” He went down, “Well, Lord, here’s my bullock.” See, there’s no sincerity in it, there’s no understanding to it. Now, we don’t want to take communion like that. That’s the same thing has become to the Lord’s table. Isaiah 35 … No, I beg your pardon. Isaiah 60 … Let me take that back. I believe it’s Isaiah 28, is where we find this. I’m pretty sure that’s the right chapter. He said, “Precept must be upon precept; and line upon line upon line; here a little, there a little. Hold fast to that what’s good. With stammering lips and other tongues will I speak to this people. And this is the Rest.” He said, “All the tables of the Lord has become full of vomit. Who can I teach Doctrine? Who can I make to understand?” See? I think that was the right Scripture, Isaiah 28. “Who can I make understand Doctrine?” See, “the tables.” Now, we find out today that this great thing that we’re fixing to do tonight, in commemoration of His death and His Body that we believe that we eat daily, or, just got through eating as our brother preached to us. Taking the Word of God, we believe It with all of our heart. We see It manifested; we see It given to us; we see It vindicated; we feel It in our lives. And we must come to this with a deep conscience of what we’re doing, not just because it’s an order. You go into church, and many times they give out an old soda cracker or some kind of a something, break it up, and light bread or something, and break it up; and people who smoke, drink, everything else, because they’re a member of the church they come and take the Lord’s supper. Well, that’s filthiness before God! Even the sacrifice, said, “Your holy days and your sacrifice become a stench in My nose.” Yet He ordained them to make that sacrifice. But the way they treated it, it become a stench, stink in His nose (His nostrils), the very sacrifice that He ordained. That’s the way we take the Word of God, too many Christians today (so-called) does that. We stand up here and teach this Word, and say, “Jesus Christ isn’t the same yesterday, today, and forever,” and teach the things that He promised us that He would honor, and say, “Oh, well, that was for something else,” our solemn worships just become a stink in His nose. He will not receive it, by no means. That’s the reason, by our traditional habits! You don’t take the Lord’s supper by a tradition. You take it because it’s the love of God in your heart, in keeping the commandments of God. See, that’s what you take it for. So if you don’t take it in sincerity, just it’s a tradition, “Well, our church observes communion once every Sunday, or once every month, or twice a year,” and you go up, say, “Well, it’s my time,” and then take the communion, why, it’s a stink to God! See, that’s just a tradition. Even like anything else, you’ve got to be sincere. God wants the depths of your heart. You remember, the very God that brought you here on earth is the One you’re serving. See? You’re doing this because He said so, because it’s His order. Then we want to come up with deepness of sincerity, knowing that by God’s grace that we have been saved. And we love Him and we feeled His Presence, and we see It change our lives. Our whole being is changed. We’re different people. We don’t live like we used to, we don’t think like we used to. Like in the Book here, and the spot there we was talking about the two Books being One, the Book of Life. The first Book of life coming up, was when you were born, that was your natural birth. See? But then one time, way back down in there, there was a little grain of Life as I was explaining to some of the young sisters at the house this afternoon. See, there’s a little grain of Life laying there, that you wonder, “Where did It come from? What these strange things?” I was saying this, taking for myself, like you was going to say, “William Branham, well, forty years ago, the William Branham, it isn’t the same one tonight.” If somebody back there would say, “William Branham, he was a rank rascal,” see, because I was born of Charles and Ella Branham. In their nature I was a sinner, I came to the world, a liar, and all the habits of the world laid right in me. But down in there, too, was another Nature present, see, predestinated, was in there by God. In this same body, see, two natures in there. Well, I only catered to one. As it growed, I gooed as a baby, “Dad-da.” First thing you know, I become a liar, become everything else that’s a sinner, because I raised up that way. But down in there was a little speck of Life all the time. I used to remember, as a little boy … (I hope I’m not holding you too long. But knowing … ) Sitting out in the … on the creek bank, and I’d sit there and look around at nighttime. Pop and mom, they’re gone on now to their rest. And them days they were sinners, there was no Christianity in our homes at all. And, oh, my, drinking, and parties, and carrying on; it made me sick, I’d take my lantern and my dog and go to the woods, to stay all night. In the wintertime I’d hunt till the party was over, maybe daylight in the morning. Come home, wouldn’t be over, I’ve laid on top of a shed and sleep, waiting for daylight to break. Then I’d think of how that times, then being out there in the summertime, get my sticks and put them down for a little windbreak, where if it rained; lay there and have the poles sticking in the water, fishing; my old coon dog laying there. I’d say, “Looky here. You know, last winter I camped right here one night, I built a fire right here when I was waiting for my old dog here to tree, and I had a fire here. It was froze five inches deep in the ground. But, little flower, where did you come from?” See? “Well, and where’d you come from? Who come out here and planted you? And what hothouse did they bring you out of? Or what about it, where’d you come from?” See? That little flower, I’d say, “Why, it was froze, and everything, and I built a fire on top here. Besides the freezing element, there was a heat element laying here on a big old log where I burned you. And yet here you are, and you’re alive. Where’d you come from?” What was it? There was another William Branham. See? A little spot of Eternal Life down there, from the genes of God, the Word of God that was placed in there. Each one of you can think of similar things. See, It was working. Then look up to the trees, and I think, “Leaf, I seen you fall off last year, and why are you back there again? Where’d you come from? What brought you here?” See, It was that Eternal Life working in the body. Now, then one day as I walked on, that Voice talking, “Don’t never smoke, drink, so forth.” And the young fellows and all got older. See, there was Something moving. But yet all at once I looked up, and I said, “I’m not the son of Charles and Ella Branham. There’s Something calling.” Like my little eagle, “I’m not a chicken. There’s Something up yonder, somewhere. O Great Jehovah, Whoever You are, open up! I want to come home. There’s Something in me, calling.” Then I was born again. That little Life was laying there, the life of water was poured upon It, then It begin to grow. Now, that old life was forgiven, put in the sea of God’s forgetfulness, to never be remembered against me no more. See? Now we stand justified (as though we never had sinned) in the Presence of God. Then when we come to the Lord’s table, we must come in reverence, love and respect, of “Look where we would have been if it hadn’t been for Him.” See? Look where it would’ve … Therefore, Paul, I think, in saying this, “Wherefore, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for the other.” That is, other words, just wait a few minutes, pray, check yourself out. And if you know a brother is in there, just about to do something that’s wrong, or something, and you pray for him, too. See? See, “tarry one the other,” wait just a minute, pray. If there’s any feelings between you or something, don’t—don’t do it—don’t do it, go make that right, first. See? Go straighten that up, first, because we want to come here just as pure as we can be, and our thoughts of one another and to God, and to each other, and then we come in fellowship around the table of the Lord. See? And we do this because that we are giving thanks to Him, and among one another. Eating the bread between each other, drinking the wine between each other, as His Blood and His Flesh. “Except you eat the Flesh of the Son of man and drink His Blood, you have no Life in you.” See? You see, that’s what the Bible said. Except you do it, there’s no Life. You see? You are then, more or less, showing you are ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian, because of the life that you live. And then this is really the showdown. Then if you don’t do it, you have no Life. If you do do it unworthily, you are guilty of the Body of the Lord. Same thing in water baptism. If we say, “We believe on Jesus Christ, He saved us from sin, and we are baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ,” why, we bring disgrace to Him, we do the things that’s wrong and we’ll have to pay for that. And another thing, when we do that, we are trying to profess one thing and do another. That’s the trouble of us today. What I think … I’m saying “us,” me, and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours, that we believe we’re in the closing time. We believe that God has give us a Message. It’s been ordained of God, It’s been proven of God, It’s been showed of God. Now we must come to Him with reverence and with love, and with purity of heart and mind and soul. You know, the hour will soon arise when right among us will be … the Holy Spirit will speak out like It did in Ananias and Sapphira. Remember, see, that hour is arriving. See? And we are … Now, you just remember that, see, that God is going to dwell among His people. That’s what He wants to do now. We can receive the Message, as saying … If I was a young man and hunting for a wife, and I could find a wife, I said, “She’s just perfect. She’s a Christian. She’s a lady. She’s all this, I got confidence.” No matter how much confidence, how much I think she’s nice, I’ve got to receive her, she’s got to receive me; see, upon these vows. Well, it’s the same thing we find is the Message. We see It’s right. We see God vindicates It’s right. It’s perfectly right. Year after year, year after year, It continues right, continues right. Everything It says, happens just exactly the way He said. Now, we know It’s right, but, see, don’t do it from an intellectual standpoint. If you do, you got a second-handed religion. See? We don’t want a second-handed religion, something that somebody else has experienced it and we are living off of their testimony. As I believe it was Jesus said to Pilate, something, a word I was thinking, and He said there just a few moments ago, “Who told you that?” Or, “Was it revealed to you? How did you know these things?” in other words. I don’t know just what the word is now, it’s been a long time since I read it, but, “How did you know this? What? How? Who revealed this to you?” About Him being the Son of God. “Who revealed it to you? Did some man tell you that? Or,” as Jesus said, “is it My Father in Heaven which has revealed it to you?” See? See? “How did you learn it, a secondhand or is it a perfect revelation from God?” Is this communion just something I go up for it, an order, say “Well, the rest of them take this, I will too”? It’s a revelation that I am part of Him and I’m part of you, and I love you and I love Him, and we’re taking this together as a symbol of our love to God, and our love and fellowship to one another. Now I want to read some from the Scripture. And then I guess … Where do you … Whichever way Brother Pearry desires today. I wish you’d read it with me, if you got your Bible. First Corinthians, the 11th chapter, and begin with the 23rd verse. And then also, at our tabernacle, we’ve always observed this and feet-washing, always, because they go hand in hand together. I believe the brother announced that “Wednesday night” because of the crowds and you don’t have enough to … room to get the people in for feet-washing, they’re going to observe this Wednesday night. Now, 23rd verse of the 11th chapter of First Corinthians, listen at Paul now. Now remember, and keep this in mind, Galatians 1:8, “If we or an angel from heaven preaches any other gospel unto you,” (than this Gospel that he had preached) “let him be accursed.” See? For I have received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had gave thanks, he brake it, … said, Take and eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. Now, let me stop right here, to say: but taking the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in this communion, does not mean that that communion is the literal body of Christ. That’s Catholic. I do not believe that that’s right. I believe it’s only an ordinance that God made with us, see, it isn’t the actual body. It’s … Now, it’s really a little piece of kosher bread. It’s just an ordinance. Neither do I believe that the baptism of Jesus Christ (in the Name of Jesus Christ) in water does forgive your sins. I do not believe that you … I believe you could be baptized all day long … Now, I know that there’s perhaps people sitting here who come from the Apostolic church, I mean, or the United Pentecostal church, which they teach that. But, you see, I do not believe that the water forgives sins. Or, if it was, then Jesus died in vain. See? I believe that it’s only an ordinance of God, see, to show that you have been forgiven. But to be baptized for regeneration, no, I don’t believe that. I don’t believe that water forgives sins. Neither do I believe that this bread and wine has anything to do with you, only keeping an ordinance that God has ordained for us to do. See? That’s right. I believe water baptism is the same thing. I believe it’s compelling to us to do it, that He had done it all for our example. And He done this for our example. And He washed feet for our example. Now, “After the same manner also,” 25th verse: After the same manner also he took the cup, and when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me. For as oft … (Remember now!) … For as oft as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do shew forth the Lord’s death till he comes. (How long? “Until He comes!” See? See?) Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. Let me stop just a minute. The reason he said this, you noticed in another verse here, another chapter, that he said, “I understand when you come together you’re eating, even getting drunk at the Lord’s table.” They misunderstood it, you see. They just glutton-ed in, see. Just like people are doing today, just live any kind of life and take it. See? He said, “You got homes to eat in, see. But, this is an ordinance that we should keep, see.” Now: But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. (See?) What are you? You’re a Christian, you live before everybody as a Christian. And if you take that and don’t live as a Christian, you’re not discerning the Lord’s Body. You’re putting a stumbling block in somebody else’s way, see, as they see you trying to do that and then not living what you’re supposed to live. See, you’re not discerning the Lord’s Body. Now watch what it … what the curse of it is: For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many are sleep. (The right translation of that word, Brother Pearry, is “dead.” See? See, “many are dead.”) For if we would judge ourself, we should not be judged. (See, if we judge ourself we won’t be judged. See?) But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. (See, not any attach to the world.) Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, tarry one for the other. (See?) And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto condemnation. And the rest I will set in order when I come. (See?) Now, in other words, don’t just come to take it as a … As I said a while ago, about what the Jews, their sacrifice, they … It was wonderful, it was given by God, but it got to a place where they didn’t do it in sincerity and reverence and in order, then it become just a … it become a stench in His nose. Now, the same thing is by our coming to take the Lord’s supper, that, we must come knowing what we are doing. Just like when you go into the water to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, you know what you’re doing, you’re putting on to the church what God has put in you, Christ. When we take this, it shows to the church, that, “I believe every Word of God. I believe that He is the Bread of Life that come from God out of Heaven. I believe every Word that He says is the Truth. And I live by It, to the best of my knowledge, God being my Judge. Therefore, before my brothers, before my sisters … I do not swear, I do not curse, I do not do these things, because I love the Lord, and the Lord knows it and bears me record. Therefore, before you, I take the parcel of His body, to know that I am not condemned with the world.” See, there you are, then it’s a blessing. And, remember, I could give many testimonies on this, where I’ve took that and explained it in a sickroom, and seen them healed. Remember, when Israel taken the type of this, they journeyed forty years in the wilderness and their clothes never even wore out, and they come out without one feeble one among them, with two million people as a type of this. Well, what will the Anti-type do? If the body of a sacrificial animal did that for them, what would the Body of Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, do for us? Let’s just be reverent when we come. Let us be just as reverent as we know how, to come.
